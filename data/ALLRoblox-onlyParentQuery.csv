My 7 y/o daughter whom I thought was an angel compared to her older sister, I found out she got banned for a day for saying ""bye btc"" to someone.  'Btc' apparently is an abbreviation for bitch, a way to get around the word filter.  I would assume she didnt even know what the letters btc meant and was only using it because someone else did....if only she didn't get caught a couple months earlier saying ""fuk u"" to someone on a YT comment section.  She was absolutely devastated when I caught her, she never uses these words IRL.  Anyway you have to be careful and monitor your kid all the time on Roblox, don't get mistaken for it all being innocent kid friendly.  I've seen my older daughter in a ""free paint"" type of game, and multiple kids were just using it to draw penises, boobs, and all types of curse words all over the walls.  

Can anyone else tell me which other games I need to look out for other than these free draw/paint griffiti type games.  I've seen some borderline innappropriate behavior in Brookenhaven.  What games should I pay closer attention to with my little one?",N/A,N/A

You sound like a helicopter parent. All ur going to do by trying to keep her away from bad stuff is increase her curiosity. Creating a rebel who won't listen to  a word you say. Take it from someone who became a rebel. 

There's worse things that calling people bitches. At this point in society people are almost desensitized to it. 

Be worried about the real problems. Like drugs and crime. 

Roblox is a safe place for the most part. Let kids be kids. But teach her about unsafe websites and talking to strangers online outside of game chats.",jayvdhx,N/A

Games like Isle or Natural Disaster Survival are good in the way that there are other people but they’re so busy playing that they don’t have time to think of slurs.,jaxzakc,N/A

Any city/high school roleplay game is infamous for having bad players. I'd also watch over what groups she joins, as those more isolated communities like military groups, school roleplays or other organizations can often be toxic. Royale High can also have some bad eggs, and it encourages microtransactions.

I recommend guiding her towards moreso minigame-like experiences. Work at a Pizza Place, for example.

Otherwise you need to buy robux packages. So its gone from $25 gift card getting 2199 robux down to around 1250 robux. What a joke.,j6vi677,N/A

I had 2 cents left over which converted to 2 robux as under 5 dollars you can convert now. And then I just cancelled premium subscription .

So this is the best way to go 2642 robux for 25 and.

Tou select robux gift card when you goto pay and the. It shows the amount in USD. 

I don't understand it but it changed to 19.99 USD and 4.99 USD respectively.

comment,https://i.redd.it/k19dluyprpfa1.jpg,N/A,richcvbmm,2023-02-02,1675357783.0,1,"So from what I gathered, Roblox is changing the “convert to robux” option because on the buy robux page, it changes the price of robux based on the location your trying to buy it from. for example Canada or the US. this is because $1 US is $1.32 CAN. But the “Convert to Robux” option did not. So if you bought and redeemed a $25 gift card bought in Canada, you would then have $25 of credit. But the “convert to Robux” option treated it as $25 US not $25 CAN. So the problom starts once you convert the credit to robux. This is because when you convert it, it would give you robux equivalent to $25 US. Which is $33.29 CAN. So you would get extra Robux equivalent to $8.29 CAN or $6.22 US.

HOWEVER, there are games where strategy is needed and not just spamming stuff like the Tower Defense games and those are famous, you can make it more enjoyable for the kid to help him understand these strategies since other older kids tend to bully those who don't read these strategies(and don't bother to), and don't worry, there are google docs for strategies and a large community dedicated to writing guides for these complex games so you don't need to make things yourself.

To make it more fun for him is quite open ended. There is a subscription service for robux, once a month, could be worth looking into. Other than that, might just be a matter of finding the right games.  
As a kid I loved quick minigames and obbies. I would start with:  
Epic Minigames, The Normal Elevator, Work at a Pizza Place, Speed Run 4, Build a Boat for Treasure, Hide and Seek Extreme, and Zombie Rush.  
These are fairly old and simple, so they’re good starting points to find what kinds of games your son likes.

Also there’s games like obby where you puzzle your way around by jumping and trying not to be eliminated. 

There’s also math games, typing games, you can almost name it and find something associated with it. It took a couple of years growing up but his friends are finally old enough to pass around their Roblox usernames and now he spends a lot of time with them.

Also after some time of letting your child find their go-to favorites it isn’t all that bad to teach your child how to save or spend money by subscribing to a low tier premium pass which gives a fixed income of robux and in some games there are boosts or benefits for premium members. It’s not in a lot of games but there are some benefits to premium.

From time to time whenever I join any game I get these friend requests mostly from people that are bacons or they don't seem like they have any robux and all their clothes are free, the thing is I don't mind that at all but what I can't accept anymore is sometimes and when I say sometimes I mean pretty often someone will come to me (at any game) and ask for robux.

It gets annoying to the point where I don't want to play Roblox anymore, Roblox is my favorite game and I don't want to stop only because someone's going to walk towards me and ask for donations

I'm a parent and think spending money on in game purchases is dumb. I realize this is a free game so buying some things in game I guess is probably expected. But it's to the point that I'm over $100 of real money for fake in game money for my kid. At what point do I say no more. I want him to have fun with the game but I can't justify buying more fake money. Even with his money.  Unless he needs it to play the game. Like I buy the game pass each month for Fortnite because I think he needs it to play with his friends. But this seems irresponsible.

Hi, I am a proud young father of 2 beautiful little girls. aged between 4 and 6.

I love the platform and I love the idea of being able to create your own unique experiences and sharing them with people with the same interests.

This game is something special and I am sure it is one of the biggest idea of the recent years for the gaming industry.

I am a programmer myself, so I naturally gravitate to this type of games, where the developers encourage players to create and learn different computer science skills, be it basic, or advanced (there are some really impressive stuff people have done using this engine).

My kids and I love this game, we play some servers together and enjoy customizing characters and building our own worlds.

Sadly, my wife and I are concerned about how the age rating is managed because some unapproved worlds/servers are really children friendly, but there's obviously more mature content on the platform. And I hate the fact that restricting my kids accounts will remove the fun for them (specially the older one), adding to that, it's pretty annoying having to remove and reactivate restrictions because they want to play a disneyland server and I not wanting them to get near worlds like [Elmira](https://www.roblox.com/games/7506230120/ELMIRA-Horror).

I could block certain words from the browser they use to play roblox, but they have multiple devices and that would take too much effort as well.

Why can't devs enable a parental filter using tags and give parents the option to block certain tags they don't want their children to see?

It is really not that hard, and it would take very little effort, so please consider it, young children deserve diversity, freedom and safety as well.

Kind regards.",N/A,N/A

Roblox's Lack of filtering in regards to games. Don't take my word for it, but while this may be a good idea, this is easier said than done. The problem is, Roblox does not provide anything for game developers to determine if the user is older or under the age of 13.

First, a quick background, then I'll ask my actual question. I don't play Roblox, but my daughter in-law does. A LOT. Probably too much...she doesn't get game time at her dad's because he's one of those ""internet is evil/downfall of society"" types, so we tend to be a little more lax at our place. But lately it's been too much, and her attitude has shifted and she's gotten.....idk, best word for it is ""weird"" about the game, the time she spends in it, and most importantly, how her mom and I view her time and habits in the game. Child in question is about to turn 16, and my overall concern is both time spent in-game and what she's DOING in game. I'll elaborate, hoping that some random internet stranger out there has run into something similar and can offer some insight and advice, because overall, random internet strangers tend to be happy to do just that more often than not.

Like I said, I don't play myself, but it seems like an innocent enough game, and I didn't see any issue with her spending time in it creating characters, running about and chatting with random folks about common interests etc etc. It's mostly about shared anime interests and other games they like to play. But within the past couple weeks, we've noticed her sneaking downstairs at all hours of the night to play, so we checked the tablet for game times/usage, and after about a week of that, we're talking about like almost 20 hours/day on Roblox. That's obviously a concern, and had we noticed the sneaking out of bed sooner we would have nipped that in the bud immediately, but she's very sneaky, and her being up before us is common (she's a 5am kid by nature) and frankly, we just didn't realize it was happening. So that's the time spent concern, which is pretty easily fixed with some reasonable game time limitations and a conversation. We had that conversation, and her reaction to it was so out of character that now we're really concerned as to WHAT she's been up to in there. It was a guilty, ""deer in the headlights"" reaction, like she got caught doing something she knew damn well was not ok...

Her mom got into the game's chat window one evening when she was being particularly dodgy about what she was up to in-game to see if she could see anything obviously amiss - racial stuff, sexual stuff, that sort of thing, and we pretty quickly realized we simply DO NOT know enough about the game, the dialogue and abbreviations or the overall in-game community to even really make sense of what we were reading. Near as I can tell tho, it seems there's some kind of in-game relationship, some sort of love triangle or something? Is that...a thing? Does that sort of thing go on in this game? I'm not judging, I was doing weird stuff on the internet at that age too, but this is having IRL effects on her moods, attitude, sleep patterns, etc. 

So, I guess my question is, what did we stumble onto, how worried should we be, and is there some sort of sexual lingo or component to the game that I had no idea existed? Or are we overthinking it and she just got stuck into a bit of an obsession to the game (we've all been there, I lost about a week of sleep when Skyrim first came out) Can it all be solved by pulling her into other interests for awhile to ween off the Roblox dopamine hits, or is there a darker, seedier component to the game that involves stuff that's a lot more concerning than simple hyper fixation? 

Any input is welcome, and yes, I realize parenting mistakes were made here as well, I'm not blaming any of this on the kiddo, just trying to understand what's happening and how to help resolve it. I don't have any kids of my own, and the whole idea of parenting is new to me...idk WTF I'm doing...but I've seen a definite shift in her daughter's overall behavior, and her mom's brain has gone to the darkest possible place about all of this, so I'm searching for anything I can do to help resolve it and ease her mind about the whole thing. And if you've made it this far, thanks for sticking it out, I know this a TL:DR type of post! :)",N/A,N/A

Roblox allows you to see the last few dozen games played. She may be addicted to a specific Roblox game or even multiple. It's possible she just really likes a game on Roblox. A lot of games on the platform are pretty addicting. If you're worried about that you could try to find something else for her to do. There are also some weird social hangout games (Like Public Bathroom games). Those types of games are packed full of people doing inappropriate stuff that Roblox needs to crack down on. But I don't know if that's the case here. If you can name some games she played I could tell.

Also, I highly doubt you'd find anything too raunchy in the Roblox chat because of how censored it'd be. There are ways to say certain banned words if you remove a letter from a word or shorten it. However, it should be obvious from the context what the word meant so there probably isn't anything you'd miss there. Plus, if there was anything suspicious said on Roblox it'd probably be in-game and you wouldn't be able to see the chats from that. If she made any good friends on Roblox she'd have probably added them on Discord or another messaging app/social media to avoid issues with Roblox's chat filter. If you were worried about her interactions online you'd have to check her chats on those apps. Only do that though if you really suspect she's talking to the wrong people though. Prying through someone's private chats without consent is a huge invasion of privacy.",jap6ymv,N/A

BTW if you see a lot of ""#####"" messages in the chatbox then it could be ppl trying to bypass, so then something shady is going on.

Most of the competitive games hav a community that is so toxic, it makes the chernobyl disaster look like a minor oopsy. Roblox moderation is also not good. U should remember the abbreviations and search them up on the internet. U can also check her game history through recently played. Avoid any simulator games because 90% are just clicking with massive goals to reach, which takes up 90 to 100% of the playtime.

Slowly give her less time to play, so slowly it's practically impossible to notice that something is going on this idea could definitely work but it will also take a very long time. 2. Talk to her about it, maybe that can work too. 3. Seek guidence from more professionals. I had a similar experience were overnight I would do nonstop attempting to play an online game, my reasoning for it was not because something new was happening no it was wayyy worse I had a thing for someone else there and I eventually grew out of it but it was exactly what you said your child started doing, overnight from playing regularly to excessive play sessions with no beak but food water shower and sleep.

I’m just a normal Roblox player, no one special. But today, I saw someone mention their full snapchat name in the Roblox Chat. This is seriously concerning. If you don’t know, snapchat is a social media which has very unique features. One of its features is it allows people to actually share their exact location on a “snapmap.”

The person who said their snapchat user in the Chat, I added him. It was exactly what I thought. It was a creepy, disgusting guy looking to find little kids to talk to. (I was on a fake account) And going back to the map, if your kid has snapchat, please make sure their snapmap is turned off and monitor your kids online activity. If you don’t know how to turn off your kids snapmap, search up a tutorial on YouTube. Yes, sadly this isn’t the only problem on Roblox but I just wanted to address another issue some parents don’t know.

There is no space for people like this in our world. Keep monitoring your children’s media use. Please stay safe. It was actually very scary talking to the guy. He said things any creep would say. 

I may make a YouTube video on this specific topic to keep parents aware of the dangers of letting your kids use the internet without being monitored. I only have 200 Subscribers so it probably won’t reach a lot of people but I want to reach as much people as I can. I’m sorry if this paragraph was a mess, I’m a teen myself.",N/A,N/A

2. How the heck Is Roblox supposed to know that the chat had someone's Snapchat name? Roblox doesn't even allow you to say the word ""Snapchat"" in game! You expect the Roblox dev team to implement a system that scans Snapchat for all usernames and Hashtags them?
3. Roblox is a gaming platform for all ages. Banning your children from Roblox as a whole makes no sense, that's like banning your children from Youtube kids because of one video as the word ""Frick"" in it.
4. Yeah, if you don't look after your kids, they'll do some crap. 
5. I doubt, that you are a ""normal Roblox player"" or a ""teen"" Because you just sound like some Karen trying to bring awareness to a fact that harms no one!
6. Roblox is for all ages. If you don't look after your kids, they Will get into trouble and if they do, that's on you. You are making Roblox worse than it really is!",gabg97k,N/A

Image moderation programs can go so far when it comes to detecting inappropriate content; which leads to countless ways for degenerates to bypass the system. No system is perfect, but what Roblox currently have is decently working. 

Roblox gets countless complaints from parents about safety concerns, but there’s a limit how much censorship you can add to a platform until you prevent players from exercising their creativity in a good way. That’s one the reasons why the Roblox chat system is so bad; half the things we say would just end up getting hashtags is because they know they have a huge children demographic.",ga9alcj,ga8wgel

I doubt that they *WANT* their store to be in the shape that it's in for example, if you search for a specific shirt you get 999 clones of the same shirt; And this suggestion is only for going forward, to go back and dig through everything might cost more than you think, and it might take years of sifting.

Once again roblox dosnt give a shit about you, They care that your account is safe and if you give them money or not. The only reason they care about your account is because without it how would you give them money?

They do not care about the children, They only care about the money. There's a difference between caring about money because your a business, and only caring about money.

""the image moderation is the best we got"" Lol, Robloxs moderation is horrible. The captcha is garbage, 10% of the moderation messages arnt in  a language you speak

Have a complaint or want to obtain info about somthing of yours that got moderated? Well guess what you can do! you can email them, get a botted response and thats it! Its just a waste of time. 

They wont help you even if they false moderate somthing.

My friend has a terminated account, The account had nothing wrong with it. Was not connected to anything that would get it banned. Was not stolen, And had nothing uploaded. The account never spoke in chat. 

Roblox terminated it, Responded with a botted response, And was unable to provide the reason why it was terminated.

You also need to understand there are people on the platform who develop games on the site that are well over that age. Roblox also needs to deal with relations with developers on the platform too. If you would ever go to Roblox devforum, you would see how active or responsive to the developers. They actually extremely transparent their motives and goals as a company.

You’re taking for granted how hard it is to implement an auto moderation system. Facebook one of the best social media platform in the world also struggles with moderation and constantly get backlash how horrible they are with moderating content on your platform. If you were make the moderation too strict it would result in many false-positives, but if you make to loose everything can pass through. It’s also impossible to have a human moderating every single thing that gets uploaded to roblox’s servers. My argument still stands, it’s the best we got like it or not.

Yes, Roblox sends you a ticket once you sent a email through their customer service. If you were provide a cohesive argument to your appeal in the email, then there should be no problem reaching to an actual person.

This has nothing to do with anything we are talking about, Roblox barely cares about those people too. 

""They actually extremely transparent"" Yes, to every except the playerbase. So in total under 1% of users

""You’re taking for granted how hard it is to implement an auto moderation system""
I already told you its garbage. If had the chance to a real human afterwards it would be great, Instead you get automated responses and ""we dont know, we cant do anything or one of those, but in a differnt language. [because once again, they outsource their moderation]

"". If you were make the moderation too strict it would result in many false-positives,"" You mean like it already has done?

"" It’s also impossible to have a human moderating every single thing that gets uploaded to roblox’s servers"" At what point did i state i wanted every single thing on roblox to be looked at by a human? I want a human to be there to look at things that DID get moderated, decide if it was false or justified. You know, like a normal company would.

""My argument still stands, it’s the best we got"" Your argument is pretty shit, Its NOT the best. Infact its one of the worst.

""Yes, Roblox sends you a ticket"" I never said anything about a ticket, Please read my previous message, I stated that they ""Responded with a botted response""[since you wernt able to comprehend this, this is AFTER the ticket] 

At no point was i complaining about a ticket. The botted response was basically ""we cant help you"" 

They terminated an account. 

That had nothing wrong with it.

Was not connected to anything bad.

And then proceeded to not be able to do anything about it.",gacurps,gacruma

Hello there. I’m a moderate gamer myself but don’t play Roblox. My 7 year old son wants to get it. I’m good with understanding how parental settings work with limiting chat and friend requests and what not. 

My question though is about what I guess is called ‘Condo rooms’. I’ve heard about there being some pretty graphic adult content in the game. 

I just need to know how you end up there. I’m assuming you can’t just go into a random server and it be that. I’m assuming it’s by invite only. Can anyone help me out in understanding this?",N/A,N/A

To get to a ""condo room"" you have to join a game that has them.

I can assure you no front page games have the condo rooms you're talking about where they roleplay god knows what, so your child would have to deliberately look that game up or click on a sponsor.

Once they find the game though, they can play it all they want.

With that being said, there may be some parental restrictions on the app as to what games they can play, perhaps it only enables Corporate-approved games, but I am not aware of a feature like this so far as I do not have a need for one, I develop the games not play them.

Hope this helps!",goadki8,N/A

I can assure you Sir/Ma'am that Roblox is doing everything it can to get rid of such graphic games,by taking them down as quickly as possible.

&#x200B;

For the chat and friends issue, the developers have done everything they can to ensure no foul language enters the chat,but while some users have managed to bypass the censor filter, i assure you that foul language or users will not be a large problem.

&#x200B;

One thing I'd suggest is to moderate your child's use of the game,as I have to admit it is quite addictive.

(Here’s the basics) find an arrow and click/use and you get a random stand (sometimes people are toxic so beware in case some random dude bypasses)

Those usually\* are condo games, and are extremely disgusting places. I so far have assisted with 35 takedowns of them. On the other hand, some good games would be Jailbreak, tycoon games, Vehicle Simulator, Sharkbite, and my game, Lava Wars (by r132248) (and yes, the blood effect is being removed today from my game if you want to play.)

The only time they would MAYBE find that would be in a hacked/exploited server but that is extremely unlikely nowadays. The parental controls really dont do much but reduce the point of the game which is is socialise but if you really that concerned about your son just check up and ask what he is playing occasionally. Educate your kid about internet safety and you wont have to worry about most of this because 7 year olds are actually pretty smart.,goezsdr,N/A

""Boys and Girls"" is also a risk. The key word ""Adopt"" is bad too, with the exception of the game ""Adopt Me"", which is arguably the largest game out there and is ran by a group of very competent developers so I wouldn't worry too much about it.

For sponsors, those are very hard to catch. How a sponsor works is a developer sells a part of their ingame currency to the platform, and in return their game is plastered on the front page a certain amount of times for the next 24 hours. The issue with this in your case is that literally anyone, with the funds, can put any game they want up there. No games that repeatedly encourage this are usually sponsored, but a general rule of thumb for these sponsors is that if it has any of those key words, it's best to avoid the sponsor.

You can't block certain sponsors, due to as said earlier the sponsors change every minute, and are randomly picked from a pool of paid sponsors that are still active, which is usually in the hundreds of thousands.

As a whole, a 7 year old will have quite some difficulty coming across these games. Even if they do,  they have to click on it. And even if they click on it, they have to make their way to these condos. And even if they get to these condo rooms, Roblox has a very strong filter to the point that most people use implied slang when roleplaying, which a child might not understand as it is also horribly misspelled and often censored with ##### in attempts to bypass the filter. So just make sure that your child isn't in any of these games as you walk by.

I would also encourage you to get an account for yourself and pick some safe games off of the front page to play with your child, to distract them from going down a rabbit hole that could possibly lead to these hard to find club/condo games.

My final note is that Roblox does not have a search history. It does have a recently played though, so if your child recently played it you can find it on their home page.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** these games are pretty hard to come by, and a 7 year old will probably have no idea whats going on anyways. Be sure to avoid the stated keywords though, and help distract your child from boredom succumbing them by playing safe front page games with them.",goaiv81,goahqti

There really needs to be a way to set limits or require a pin on in-game purchases that use Robux. Id like to buy robux for my Kid but with how poorly Roblox regulates their game makers it is not safe at all. Too many games out there that will pop up a random in game useless item for  200 Robux that is one time use hoping a kid accidentally clicks buy  trying to get back into the game. Not to mention some games just  absolutely spam you with ingame purchase popups ever 2 seconds.

Something like this happened to me, just a different scenario. 
I was playing a game on Roblox with my VR headset. Everything was great until I left the game and noticed that my robux went down. I apparently bought something, but I didn't see any pop-ups on my screen. Robux completely wasted and I'm scared I will lose a bigger amount next time I play in VR. 

Roblox really should make a toggle on/off feature that will let you purchase stuff in games to prevent from unwanted/accidental purchases and those annoying pop-ups.

It is the parent's fault for giving their child tons and tons of robux and expecting it to last a lifetime when their child likely doesn't understand how currency works (like how children normally don't understand how currency works).

It didn't automatically accept you just clicked the white button instead of the gray button. I don't see how you are able to get the gray button on the left mixed up with the white button on the right unless you're colorblind, can't read, and don't know the difference between right/left.

Blox Fruits: I hate it even though it's a decently coded game,  although I don't think it deserves THAT many players so I'd say not deserved. Maybe like 120K-210K would be deserved.

Adopt Me: Not the best but I can tell a lot of work went into it. Deserved.

Royal High (Or Royalloween): Just meh, It's fine. I can tell a decent amount of work is in it so I guess Deserved

Bloxburg: I'm a little bit biased because it's my favorite game but I think it's very deserved. It is a very good game and even though it's not free 25 Robux is literally under a dollar (CAD) and it's still a work in progress. Very much deserved.

Brookhaven: Ehhh. I can see the appeal but I think it's kind of lazily coded. I mean it's decent but for being the second most popular game on Roblox It looks like shit compared to the other games. I'd say not deserved

And finally Evade: Pretty good game actually!, Not exactly my type of game but I'd say it's still really good. I understand why so many people like it. Deserved!",irk3m0h,N/A

Blox Fruits copies an anime that is actually made well.

Adopt Me should be named Adopt Pets, because nobody has adopted a person in Adopt Me since the pets update dropped.

Royale High is so incredibly low quality I won't even give it the compliment of another word.

Brookhaven does not deserve to even exist.

Evade is a fun game. Though it can get boring for a bit as all the nextbots do the same thing. I can see why people play it as some can't buy GMod. But just play GMod for the experience if you can afford it or have it.

Adopt me is well, adopt me. one of the addicting kids games on roblox, with no real purpose other than to gamble for virtual dragons that are cyberpunk 2099 colors, not deserved.   


I've never played Royal High, but I think I've got the general idea, Highschool. That's it. Not deserved.  


Welcome to Bloxburg is surprisingly worthy of the deserved, it IS basically Royal High but more life based. You build your house, get a job, get depressed, so on. Game has a point, get money to build house. Personally not my cup of tea, but deserved in some aspects.  


Brookhaven is essentially Bloxburg but more roleplayish and you can't build a house other than just choose the model of the house, and you can't get a job or be depressed (unless you're an edgy 10 year old who played Shadow the Hedgehog). Not Deserved.  


Evade is Garrys mod without the freedom to spawn in a bunch of half life zombies along side some red barrels and make em go kaBOOM. Not that its bad because of that, nextbots are fun to runaway from, this game DOES take away your sandbox powers, but makes you run away from memes. Deserved.",irmlinb,N/A

Blox Fruits - Pretty fun and well made game, definitely the best anime game on roblox currently. Although i do think 600k+ concurrent players is a bit too manh weebs to my personal liking lol -- Kind of deserved

Brookhaven - Trash game. Looks like something made in 2012 using free models and the most prehistoric scripting imaginable -- Not deserved

Welcome to Bloxburg - Probably the best rolaplaying/building game on roblox. Even i, a strategy/rpg enjoyer play it sometimes just to decorate my house for the season, even if no one is going to see it lol -- Deserved

Evade - Nextbots are the peak of horror. It is unarguable that being chased by a screaming, 2D dababy in a closed space is WAY more scary than being chased by slenderman in a forest. The game is pretty fun too -- Deserved

Royale High - Very well made roleplay game, although the ""magic highschool"" vibe was never my favorite. The devs did a fantastic job briging out said vibe into life -- Deserved

Games i think should be there:
Loomian Legacy
Doors
Dungeon Quest
Tower Heroes
Tower Blitz
Lumber Tycoon 2
Theme Park Tycoon 2

Yeah, i know it's a lot of games, but if one of them was in the top 5 i would be very happy",irn1bjw,N/A

It's really easy to beat when you know how to deal with all the monsters. There is no thrill to it except maybe for that one guy who chases you through rooms rush and and ambush are just png's. And I know the recent popularity in pngs chasing you but I feel like i the devs were just being lazy with them. That goes with enemy animations as well. It's just not that well made as a game. But there is an upside. To revive yourself in bame is only 30 robux which is very generous compared to other games. And the idea of ai generation for levels is also pretty cool.,irme0gx,irknzky

Let’s take Midnight Horrors for example, another survive the killers formula game, which has 450+ killers, with the whole idea for (mostly a joke game) having really unique and cool ideas to threaten the player with, 200+ maps, all at different sizes and even have traps on some of them, to further threaten the player. Midnight Horrors also has around 150 emotes, all costing survivals, with the most expensive being 25000, a goal not many have reached but it keeps the player playing. All of this put together really gives the player something to come back to again and again as you could play for years and not experience all maps or killers (emotes probably not) as there is just so much. Compared to evade, I think this has way more replayability and is just more fun in general since you’re just running away from randomised bots that just chase you, whereas you have killers like Ashpit, who do nothing themselves to kill the players, but they spawn humanoid ash creatures (no idea what to call em) that hunt players around the map, and Ashpit spits fire around the map periodically, where if the ash creatures were to make contact with this fire, they will ignite and will turn into a ticking time bomb. (Also the fire ignites the player for about 10s if they step on it.)",irn0ai2,irkjxzp

comment,https://i.redd.it/wbl6csjq4ls91.png,N/A,Vill1on,2022-10-09,1665328843.0,1,"You’re downplaying Evade’s capabilities. The game isn’t just running from point A to point B, it also tests your reflexes, your critical thinking, and your skills at maneuvering around tight spots. 

Evades maps are inferior in count, yes, but the amount of detail they have in them is perfect for certain gameplays (even if people keep voting for the same three maps). A good example of map knowledge is by juking one nextbot and keeping it busy while the others revive the incapacitated.

Emotes shouldn’t be the thing keeping the players from playing. This isn’t TTD 3.

As for the killers themselves, their concept have been in almost every single “horror” game in Roblox that they just… stop being unique in their own accord. They’re scary, yes, but do they offer anything new to the table?

The point of Nextbots was to turn something hilariously mundane (a literal comedic schtick) into something terrifying. A playground filled with kids and you’re out here being chased by a loud vacuum cleaner endlessly looping an earraped Taco Bell sound effect — a ridiculous description, but it tricks the player’s brain into either engaging their humour, fight or flight response, or run for their lives.

Complexity ≠ Better. Another huge reason for Evade’s popularity is its simplicity and easy learning curve - it perfectly mimics Gmod (and Source games in general)’s nature. You jump in, play, and have fun. No need to heavily strategize which could lead to serious tilting because the RNG just wasn’t in your side. It doesn’t slap you with anything nor do you have to meticulously learn each and every single “villain” which, depending on the player, could take a long time.

Play Evade with your friends next time. You’ll see what I mean.",irn5sg1,irn0ai2

The current school realm has the rainbow drop things with a random variation in what you get for an st. Patrick day accessory.

I almost forgot about something though… The egg hunt from back in April that wasn’t removed.
- You get a randomly generated item from an Easter Day themed accessory. (The first egg)
- You can get from 100 to 15K diamonds out of the diamonds egg. (The second egg)

theres some rng with the current apple bobbing system, but the drop rates are pretty high so its not a huge time drainer. (basically, your character is in an apple bobbing animation until you get an apple, which happens usually after every 2-3  five second animation cycles)

First of all, lemme clarify, I have no problem with the event, the judges did a great job, except from the fact that my fps is like 10 when I attempted the final battle.

I sacrificed my sanity and my time just so I could play the final battle, Oh wait. My parents won't let me stay up even though I let them know at least a week in advance (because of the delays)

So I woke up the next day and I see that not many people have completed but because I missed all the streams and nobody posted guides.

After a while, I started to figure out all the steps, some of which were ridiculously hard to figure out by yourself. Then, by the time I'm at the final battle against JP, with having completed everything previously at 17 fps, my fps drops to 10, and I see that around 5k players have gotten the gold crown, which was what I was aming for. Also at around this time was when the first guides started popping up which, sadly I didn't need. And then I found out there was parkour. 

That was it.  Game Over.

Ggs to all who got the gold crown and hood. 

I might try to get the crown post nerf, but this event didn't work out for me.

Solid 10/10 for the experience though but I was playing on mobile so I couldn't see all the good stuff.

Firstly, the only problem with your script is that ""CanColide"" should be spelled ""CanCollide"".

Now, in terms of better habits:  
\- change `wait(3)` to `task.wait(3)`  
\- change `script.parent` to `script.Parent`

you could also just do:  
`Platform = script.Parent`

`while task.wait(3) do`  
`Platform.CanCollide = not Platform.CanCollide`  
`Platform.Transparency = math.abs(Platform.Transparency - 1)`

when its on the 3rd line of setting transparency, the loop will make every second a new execution, that mean on line 2 and 1 is executing too, that mean its changing 3 times in the same time

idk how to make it not execute every time, only when it reach at the end it restart, pretty sure is with a until

also he could do `for i = 0, 1, 0.05 do`, that would increase 0.05 each time until 1

What the others suggested does work, but using the TweenService is better since you don't need to work out a perfect value for wait() for it to look smooth or anything.

Also with TweenService you can add easing, which is like a 'style' to how the value interpolates between the start and end value. Could go slow in the start then start speeding up, etc.

Do not use a loop + wait for things like this",il7y89v,il732zl

With other companies you just log in, find the ""delete my account and associated data"" button, click it, and it's done... but nope... not with Roblox...

Ok, so the title says it all. I am sick of seeing all these games that are clearly a cash grab, and I have been blind to it until recently checking what my son has been begging for Robux for. Take for example Ninja Legends 2. These guys just put some shine on the original game and put a number 2 at the end of it. There is nothing new about the second game!! I just checked it myself on my sons tablet.

Why do the people who run Roblox let this stuff fly? Games like this only rename their original game and call it new so it forces children to re buy the same packs they already had, and the sad part is, many of these small children fall for it and beg their parents to buy them Robux to pay for something they already got..... its highway robbery. Something needs to be done about this soon. Roblox seems to be getting worse with all the Robux scams I need to constantly monitor that my kid is not falling for and now I have to make sure game creators are not ripping my kids off. I, and many parents in my community are going to start stepping up soon to try getting news out about this if something is not done soon. This stuff has to stop, and you need to stop letting people like this take advantage of children.

Edit: Forgot to add that I also play some games with my children on Roblox like Bee Swarm Simulator and a couple others, so this is how I know when I am seeing a scam, or something fishing going on.

UPDATE: Ok so I got what I needed from this thread, I will still stop in and reply once in a while, and I will just leave it here for people to discuss among themselves their experiences with games on the platform. People tell me I am wrong, but there is a reason this thread has so many up votes and support in the comments. Only people telling me im wrong are kids who like the game, or the studios goons they send to down vote and trash talk the thread. Parents are starting to remove their kids from the Roblox platform, and justly so. They are no longer a safe platform for children as they once were.

Bubblegum Simulator is a prime target for this. 2x hatch speed, 2x luck, multi egg hatches, auto resource collect (totalling at around 2-3k robux). honestly such a disappointing turn for roblox games IMO. take this with a grain of salt since i've never played ninja legends 1 or 2, and probably dont plan on it.",giadfz4,N/A

All these ""simulator"" games are mostly the same thing. It is a business practice. Child play game, game get too hard, then they buy stuff for robux to make it easier. Like the other commenters said, there isn't much the staff at ROBLOX can do about it. It is, essentially, making ROBLOX money too, since there is a cut of the robux purchases made in games going to roblox staff, so maybe that is why they won't moderate these simulator cash grabs.

What can YOU do about it?

Not much. Teach your child that maybe these games aren't worth their time. Maybe help them survey the site and see any other interesting games your child might play. At the end of the day, it all comes down to you.

As far as I have seen, this is a mildly rare occurance of repackaged games made sequels. So this is one of those rare occurrences, don't worry about that too much.",giafecg,N/A

Roblox does not care that much for the quality of the gaming hemisphere or the site itself too much. As long as they are pulling in millions of dollars, “who cares if games are preying on little kids, it’s making us rich.”

I can’t even put the blame all on Roblox because they don’t make the games. I’ve been a player since 2011. The community had its faults then as it does now but it just wasn’t this bad or heartless. Biggest reason is because of the developer exchange. As great as it is. Now it’s kinda trash because the rates aren’t good but yeah it makes people want to generate as much robux as they can on their game just to cash out. Honestly sadly this type of bull crap only works on children. And Roblox didn’t originally market towards children until obviously the saw the profit potential.

There are still many games that are made for fun and aren’t pay 2 win. But it gets harder and harder to find if you aren’t an og of roblox or deep in the dev community.

And stuff does get changed code wise and visual wise. It's just how sequels usually are executed. 

The same happens with FIFA, a less obvious but similar thing happens with assassin's creed and even GTA. Mechanics get changed but the core mechanics remain the same conceptual wise. It's what it is and there's little to change about it.

As for background info as to how I kno this, I myself am a roblox developer (programmer specifically) and work as a freelancer for several years now and am currently majoring in Game Development as an education, you can check me out under the name VoidedBlades. 

I'd just like to point out that these ""cash grabs"" are nothing more but a kid liking something and wanting to spend money on it, could even compare it to a person's hobby where they'd spend thousands of dollars on it. or even continuously buying lego for a kid as they love to play with it. However hobbies will usually change with time.

I just find it simply rude to claim that they just take the same game and rename it. A lot of work goes into reworking a game for a sequel even though a consumer might not directly see it.

Last but not least, we also need to make money to live. Roblox is our source of income despite it being an instable soure as income fluctuates heavily for a lot of developers.

These ""Simulator""-type games are specifically engineered to draw kids in and take their money, their greed tarnishing the very reputation of Roblox game development in general. 

The game dev community is kinda split into two types of developers: Those who actually MAKE good games and those who make cash grabs to take people's money. I call them ""Makers"" and ""Takers"" respectively.

The best advice I can give is to teach your child that there's no shame in playing the original game, as sequels tend to be bad anyways; and try to find some other games with actual gameplay value, so ""simulator""-type games become boring to him.",gib6rmz,N/A

A lot of games have really overpriced stuff and that makes it bad, even cash grab or scam games are really bad too.

moving onto the statements about it using all of the same gamepasses/purchases:  
the only things I can see that are similar in terms of monetization between the two (granted I've only looked at their store tab on the website) are the things like perks. 2x storage, 2x collection, that kind of thing. I don't really see anything wrong here, almost all games have them, they're entirely optional and are only there to help speed up progression.  


in summary:  
at the end of the day, its entirely up to the developer(s) of that game to choose if they want to create a sequel based off the work that they've put into it. maybe there's just more they wanted to add to the second game that they couldn't do with the first due to technical limitations, maybe they just simply needed more money as you said. the developers of this game are people too and they need to make a living in order to pay for rent, food, etc. just like everyone else. in my opinion, saying otherwise is well, putting it politely, rather disrespectful of you.",giaj1va,N/A

I can see why you're annoyed Roblox doesn't filter game quality, and I get that completely, but Roblox isn't going to take down a game for doing that, unfortunately.

If you really want to let your kid have Robux without ripping a hole in your wallet, install Google Opinion Rewards. It's a first party app by Google that's actually trustable. You answer questions related to you and other stuff, and it gives you Google play credit that expires within a year. You can spend this on anything in the Google play shop, I ncluding Robux.

I ABSOLUTELY agree with you on how games are just remade in a different context that makes it seem different, but in reality is basically the same. The thing is, ROBLOX is a place where they ""Power Imagination,"" in a nutshell. Basically every game is made by users, (As I'm sure you know,) and the userbase/developers would complain if their game was taken down for ""scams,"" as technically it's not a scam, but in essence, it basically is. My solution is to not play those games, I know the issue is that your child probably only plays those games ... and I don't know what to do about it. As for robux spending ... I've only spent it on catalog items, clothing or in the select games in play that I adore. MOST simulator games are filled with those annoying/not very useful gamepasses.  

Now for actual scams: People have tried to scam me tons of times for robux, mainly by PMs on ROBLOX. They claim to be a ""User reporter,"" or something. I've watched tons of videos on those, and no you scammers cannot have my limiteds.

But I would like to stress that not all studios are like this, There are good developers on the platform that bring interesting and unique things to ROBLOX, it is a shame that there are some bad apples that give the platform a bad rep That plus the limits of the ROBLOX engine its self, And the fact that ROBLOX gives us pretty crappy exchange rates. Which can be the reason ROBLOX games have so many microtransactions (Though I don't defend these actions And Defiantly am against pay 2 win.) Best way to find good ROBLOX games for you and your child is to avoid the front page games, They are often the more clickily microtransaction games of the platform. Instead I'd recommend searching online for some ROBLOX games that fit you and your Childs favoured genre, There are a lot of YouTube videos on good ROBLOX games. I'm not big developer or anything but I thought that might be a little bit more helpful.

As a Roblox player since 2008, I have seen the change of Roblox turning more into a cash grab platform. If you did not know, back in the early days of Roblox there used to be a 2nd Roblox currency known as Tix. Every player got 10 Tix every day as a daily log-in reward and could get more Tix by place visits in which you got 1 Tix for every visitor. The user could of spent Tix to buy items in the catalog and could trade Tix for Robux using the **RoblEX** trade system. Sadly in 2016 Roblox removed Tix making everything now require Robux, this the where the modern-day problem that you have stated comes into effect. Sadly the people who run Roblox seem to not care anymore since now they make more money from people buying Robux. The only way to see if Roblox really wants to change this is if a Tix like system returns, which will sadly most likely never happen again.",gib2csc,N/A

I'd recommend the kids to play games that are original and not that too popular since jn my experience the buy with robux pop up rarely appear to me. Avoid if not be cautious on tycoon or any other simulator shenanigans they have a cesspool of scam items that doesnt do much and might be not permanent. Teach the kids to be wary on clicking things fast without hesitation this might slwp their progression on the game they'd chosen but its the safest way.
Clothes:
Shirts and pants are repetitive and sometimes too cheap or too expensive which can scam in anyway matter. Cheaps can be deleted just like mine, they tend to sell it at 5 robux and adds an eyecatching name and design. Same with the expensive ones. In my opinion they should buy at a group ad and game clothes market or buy originals at the origin.
Accessories are okay
Gear never buy them at all
Limited they are just collectors item which they resell or something idk why.

Lastly make sure the children never go to free robux sites without their acc having a pin and a verified email. They might not take your password but they can take your IP and might use it to their advantage. Some may actually give them robux but still its better to be safe than sorry.

Roblox's moderation priorities the inappropriate sites and exploiters. But the report works i think, when you report a game or a player.",giajwb9,N/A

If a game is making everyone rebuy their packs, so be it. The smarter part of their playerbase will simply move on and stop playing. The roblox economy will decide the fate of the game.

That's it. It's people's freedom to make what games they want, play what games they want, and spend robux on what games they want. Even if a game was the scummiest thing ever that constantly reset progress and forced you to buy everything again, as long as it's not breaking any rules (such as nudity) then it's fine to be there.

The value of robux compare to the US dollar is continuing inflating every time someone buys robux. The only reason why it hasn't inflated to the point of it being post WWI Germany is this thing called tax, where roblox (the corporation) receives 30% of all robux transaction and whenever someone buys a item created by roblox with robux. The only way of obtaining robux legally is buying roblox premium because it offers more then buying regular robux, but the pricing is expensive enough where someone can't just buy over 100,000 robux without spending $1,000 usd (only reason why someone would do this is if they are investing in limited items but that's another topic) but too expensive where you not really getting your money worth if you don't buy premium.

Anyways, all games die at some point, and some game devs milk the same cow. Trying to make as much robux without much more work. And with 30% tax on purchases that affects games dev robux income, they add new stuff, maybe change visual, mostly small changes, called it ""insert game name 2"" create the game, and milk the same cow to make robux. and because its a new game, the gamepass are incompatible. So if a dev makes a net total of 140k robux off the game, that's because 30% of the gross income gets taxes, which in this example 60k robux. (They can also exchange robux to USD on a special rate and on a special program called DevEX, but thats another topic. Obviously they can only exchange their net robux income made from the game)

I have no clue if the game devs are greedy but its a economic reason of why these things happen. Its it a good reason? Most likely not. Buts its a reason as regards to economics of roblox.

If a game dev really want to make robux and have a stable income is to just update their one game instead of creating a copy of it, slap a number on it, and call it a day.",gic1eyl,N/A

Granted, I did have Roblox Premium Benefits, but I didn't spend any money on the game. I got some pets for free from some generous people and also got some pets from small Youtubers livestreaming and giving away pets. It's not that hard to play without robux. Also, the second Ninja Legends is cleaner and more challenging + interactive for users. I personally like the game a lot, and a lot of effort was put into the game, because it would take most people years to even create the map, but there is a lot of detail put into this game. It is a little bit pay to win, but every game has that aspect, no matter the size of the P2W.

Pretty all of the sports games that are out are sequels with no changes other than graphics, roster, and a new number. Not all AAA companies have bad, P2W releases, though. But, if you take a look at smaller companies making indie games, they put a lot of effort into their style, and unique gameplay.

On Roblox, simulators don’t need to put any effort into their updates, and they’ll be popular. I don’t know how much effort it takes in order to produce their types of updates, so I can’t really judge them. But, they can release the same thing they did last update but with some remodels, and a different theme.

If you play a smaller game, or a game that’s made by a good group, updates/releases might take longer to come out but they have more quality to them, and they don’t feel as lazy as the larger games.

My personal recommendation for games on Roblox include:

[Arsenal](https://www.roblox.com/games/286090429/Arsenal) \- Fast-paced FPS with its main game mode being ‘gun game’ where you get a new gun every kill.

[Loomian Legacy](https://www.roblox.com/games/306964494/Holiday-Event-Loomian-Legacy?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Pokémon like gameplay.

[Welcome to Bloxburg](https://www.roblox.com/games/185655149/Welcome-to-Bloxburg?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) (paid access) - Build a house and roleplay with others.

[Vehicle Simulator ](https://www.roblox.com/games/171391948/2021-Vehicle-Simulator?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Unlike other simulators, you actually use a vehicle to drive around, and simulate something.

[Robeats!](https://www.roblox.com/games/698448212/feat-fusq-RoBeats-MMO-Rhythm-Game?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Vertical Scrolling Rhythm game, best rhythm game on Roblox in my opinion.

[Bad Business](https://www.roblox.com/games/3233893879/Bad-Business-2-12?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Good FPS with really good, and fast movement.

[Outlaster](https://www.roblox.com/games/5343994291/Outlaster?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) or [Eviction Notice](https://www.roblox.com/games/2577040780/Eviction-Notice-BETA) \- Identical styles of gameplay where you play mini games, and vote out people in your team at the end of rounds.

[Iron Man Simulator 2 ](https://www.roblox.com/games/6097258548/Iron-Man-Simulator-2-BETA?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Simple controls and gameplay where you can use Iron Man suits.

[Horrific Housing](https://www.roblox.com/games/263761432/2021-Gift-Horrific-Housing?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Stand on plates (with various game modes) and try to survive the events.

[Black Magic II](https://www.roblox.com/games/969669348/Black-Magic-II-RANKED?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- The most unique fighting game on Roblox, game play is kind of like Street Fighter, or Dragon Ball FighterZ.

[Anime Battle Arena](https://www.roblox.com/games/1458767429/HOLIDAY-Anime-Battle-Arena) \- Fight using anime characters, the gameplay is more simple compared to Black Magic II.

[SARB](https://www.roblox.com/games/5848360485/SARB) \- Super Smash Bros. like gameplay but it's in 3D.

[Doomspire Brickbattle](https://www.roblox.com/games/1215581239/Doomspire-Brickbattle?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- A game from the older Roblox, but remastered to fit Roblox's new physics, and engine (I don't know if that's the right word for it).

[Tower Defense Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/3260590327/Tower-Defense-Simulator?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- Tower defense gameplay like Kingdom Rush, and Bloons, where you try to protect a location by placing units.

[World of Magic](https://www.roblox.com/games/3272915504/World-of-Magic?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- Open world game, with a magic combat system, and your actions affect the world.",gici0x7,N/A

Roblox has made the in-game chat system nearly unbearable to communicate almost everything is censored with hashtags. I honestly don’t know what more can you ask Roblox to do in order to ensure kids aren’t getting duped.

Here’s the silver-lining, kids who got scammed got a taste of the real world; scams don’t just happen on Roblox or online. They will learn how to be skeptical and understand when something is too good to be true.

Honestly parents with this overprotective mindset is just hurting them in the long run. Kids need to learn how the Internet works, their own action have consequences and experience the world by themselves, if they fuck up they will learn through their mistakes. I definitely fell for scams, got trolled and bullied on the internet when I was younger. I’m in my early twenties now; I turned out fine.

Unfortunately for your wallet, repackaged, rebranded, renumbered simulator games are what become popular. Take a game that has actual effort into it and compare it to any ""lifting simulator."" Kids want to play games on Roblox that they can get good at quickly, with a robux shortcut here and there. This implementation of microtransactions based on ""u spend money you get better"" is essentially what happens in every major game ever so long as it isn't based solely on PVP. Take GTA V for an example, you can buy shark cards and content packs like the CESP, and people have been complaining about this for years but nothing is done because the majority BUY THEM, the same as the majority of Roblox plyers enjoy these so-called ""cash grabs"". So, as their parent, you can tell your children they cant have robux, or you can let them have a little for them to spend wherever they want.

I gave it a good read, but it don't answer my question or concern at all. My big beef is with a game my child has been playing recently called Ninja Legends 2. I asked him today, why has he wanted Robux so badly. He replied with a smile that, a new game has been released on Roblox and he wanted game passes for it. I then asked him if I could see the game he was talking about, as sometimes I find them interesting and want to try them myself. After all, my kid is the reason I am one of the top players on Bee Swarm Sim. Anyhow. He brings his tablet over and shows me Ninja Legends 2. I had played the first one with my kids for a while, but ended up getting bored of it after a while. When he loaded the world. I was like, wait.... This looks exactly like the first game. Then I tarted checking the game passes that my son wanted. Not only are there the same ones from the first Ninja Legends, but they added new ones to scrape a little more money from our pockets.... This is a Ponzi Scheme, and in the real world, they are illegal. It almost seems like game creators for Roblox platform think they are safe from this because a bunch of children play it and don't know any better. Well I am an adult, and I have noticed it, and regardless of what people say, it's 100% wrong and it needs to have attention drawn to it.",gia612p,gia4dzm

Children will believe things are new if someone tells them it is. These are very scummy tactics and the fact that its allowed anger me. Steam has also cracked down on copy paste games, this I am thankful for, and is long overdue. So if other game gaming platforms can deal with it, I don't see why Roblox is struggling with taking care of it.

Children are easily mislead into thinking something is cool and new when its not. 

Don't get me wrong, if you are making games that are interesting and fun, then great, I would probably check those games out with my kids, because I play the games with them and I also buy game passes when I like the game, but they cant pull the wool over my eyes as easily as they do with kids.

I do, as I studied child psychology. Children are easily manipulated VIA peer pressure into spending money on this garbage. Don't come to someone who knows more about child psychology, trying to make it seem like its nothing. Kids are being conned into thinking this stuff is needed. Take for example the YouTubers being payed to falsely tell children how great and amazing the game is, how they buy the passes on stream or video showing them how powerful it makes their character. Everything about this stinks, and needs to stop. It is still against the law to manipulate children you know. Just a bit of information for ya.",gicppaq,giaxvvh

That's true but this is a minority of the games. There's no way in restricting these games to monetize themselves as that's just as wrong. 

Not to mention that this doesn't fall under scamming. Scamming would be an illegal act of swindling someone out of their money for nothing (of equal value in return) or not getting what's stated when bought, which in this case they are getting. If not it's a violation of roblox's ToU. The value here is determined by the creator and stated when bought so the upper hand lies with them.

I have yet to make an informative post about scamming matters in terms of how they work as I've previously have given an in depth informative post on the devforums about cookie logging and several commonly executed scam attempts attached to it and how to prevent it from happening to yourself.

Don't get me wrong. A reupload of a previously created game (if they own the intellectual property) is morally wrong but legally not, if it would be companies like EA would be in major trouble with their 3rd reupload of the exact same game.

The only way I'd see possible is to simply restrict kids to spend their robux on those games.",giafuju,giael0d

As I said previously, this is not ""in all aspects the same"" their new game has new (and not to mention higher quality) models, effects, artwork, animations, etc. just because the layout of the map is the same, it doesn't mean anything is wrong with it, it means that was the one aspect of the game they decided to bring over in order to make things intuitive to returning players. its not a criminal offense.
2. I am not ""defending"" any kind of behavior, I am simply stating the fact (and this is universal across all the games industry, not to mention business) that there is a certain point in a considerable overhaul where it just makes sense to create a sequel.
3. What's wrong with paid promotion? that has been happening since the dawn of YouTube and Twitch (if not earlier if you count TV ads), these developers are not the first to do this. Pretty much every games company imaginable has done this at some point. there is nothing wrong with it. there is a mutual benefit between the consumer, the content creator (weather its a youtuber or streamer, etc.) and the developer.
4. So what if they're trying to make money? Roblox as a platform is very unpredictable in terms of earnings. I cannot blame them in the slightest for perhaps monetizing *their* product in a way that will help them live in case of a sudden drop in revenue and players. you can't really blame them for not wanting to end up living on the street.",giakheg,giajm13

TIX was removed because when it was a thing, new players automatically got a certain amount of TIX (I don't know how much since it's been so many years but I'm guessing 20). You can also exchange a certain amount of TIX for exactly 1 Robux (again it's been years, so I don't know how much but I think you needed 100 TIX). So, the smart kids and adults used this to their advantage and spammed accounts and bought things that their main account made, which would usually be a shitty T-Shirt that costed TIX. The main account would get tons of TIX to exchange for Robux and the alt accounts would be left in the darkness. So, ROBLOX didn't remove it just because it wasn't making them money; they were actually losing money and the economy was being ruined.

Which is why you should probably teach your son to avoid this kind of stuff? Teach him how to avoid peer pressure and think critically? You've talked about the real world in some of your other comments. Why not kill two birds with one stone and teach him how to deal with scams, peer pressure and the like using Roblox? It's a valuable life skill. That's all I'm saying.

I was once a child. I know what it's like with this kind of stuff, and I'm glad my parents taught me how to deal with stuff like this. (Not saying you are a bad parent.)

I'm not defending these practices, I just think this rant of yours is sort of useless because nothings going to change for two reasons: A), Roblox won't care, and B) The games aren't explicity breaking any rules. They shouldn't be taken down for ""scamming"" because they technically aren't and that would lead to bad precedent for the rest of roblox's games. Kind of like a vague rule which could technically be used to take down any game roblox admins dont' want around. That example is a exaggeration but I hope you get what I mean.

Again, no one is being forced to do stuff here. Manipulation != forced, and that's why I think these games shouldn't be taken down. As addicting a game is, as manipulative a youtuber is, at the end of the line, you're choosing to spend that money, that robux, and your time. You have to learn how to control it and think through it. Hard stuff to teach to a kid, I know, but now's a good time as any to start. (Besides... can't you just outright deny him the robux? Explain why you won't give it to him? Not trying to tell you how to parent your own children, just curious.)",gie0zpk,gicppaq

Micro-transactions have become very heavy in most games. It's disappointing but expected if the dev team is looking for revenue.

The game I'm working on with my best friend consists of a currency that is earnable in-game as well. I myself despise locking players behind pay walls, or even allowing players who pay to get a large advantage.

So all the content, specifically cosmetics, are earnable. Most are locked either way, behind methods of finding them/earning them, but the ones you can purchase are bought through what we call Hypercoin.

The Hypercoin is earnable, found through lucky spawns, completing contracts, drops from bosses or even enemies, and daily rewards.

Sadly that snowballing has already been happening for years within that genre as it's to keep generating profit, there's no benefit in doing this on roblox's end as they'll lose valuable profit (their value has already been falling) nor is there anything legally that I can think of that'll make this happen.

This is something that seems uncontrollable from a consumer's perspective other than disallowing their children to spend Robux on the games that do that. 

Regardless, striving for such a change isn't bad whatsoever. It just seems out of reach in my eyes, which leaves the responsibility at the parents/guardians.

We're talking about a platform on the internet that has a main focus on having content generated for money after all. The internet is a scary place and can cause a lot of damage in a small time if treated without caution. That caution is usually one's own responsibility or of their parents/guardians.

One thing I do know is that this has only happened so far in the Roblox simulator genre (correct me if you've seen games in other genres do this) which is a current trend but should soon or later die out, just like any other trend on roblox, due to how it has been milked.",gib6z86,giah22p

I read your edit up in the post (not the comments) and you're immediately branding anyone who goes against your opinion a Roblox shill or a 7 year old kid. That really doesn't encourage thoughtful discussion and kind of shows me that there's no point trying to talk to you, as you're opinion's already been made. 

I'm not sure if you know this, but Roblox does not make the games. All of Roblox's content is completely player made. (Well, with the exception of some events and tutorial games. Heck, the whole point of Roblox originally was kids making games and playing other kid's games.) What does this mean?

Any multiplayer game has the danger of Adults and susceptible children meeting. It's not a new thing. Usually, the multiplayer game has safeguards, such as safe chat, child friendly mode, or whatever. But in the end, it's ultimately up to YOU to teach your kid how to behave safely and responsibly online. The game can only do so much.

It's almost the same in Roblox's case. These are multiplayer interactions between players to players. People playing other player's games. Not player to company. You see, that's the huge difference. They can't be held accountable in the same ways. 

I hope you understand that I'm putting emphasis on you and your son for a reason, not because I only read a few sentences of your comments. The solution is with YOU guys, not the other way around. 

Look, I understand that these practices are quite shitty. But there's a real difference between actual scams and these ""scams"". I've seen games get taken down for real scams. For instance, you buy a gamepass that promises a sword but all you get is a crappy t-shirt. That's a real, bonifide scam. Meanwhile, with your case, you're getting what you pay for. Sure, the game could only last one more day after you buy a gamepass and now you feel cheated. But the gamepass never promised how long the game would last, did it? Scummy, but legal. These practices are NOT criminal, despite how close they may seem. Taking action against things like these leave a HUGE precedent and could be damaging for all of Roblox. 

Let's talk about the targeting aspect and the kids being taken advantage of. Where does the solution lie? That's right, with YOU. Your son is choosing to play these games, and therefore he must learn how to deal with the issues on this platform. He is choosing to play these scammy games, despite there being tons of other games out there. Issues that are out of his control, like nudity, swearing, etc, that is the type of stuff Roblox is trying to prevent. 

""Children should NEVER EVER be taken advantage of by adults."" I agree, but its the goddamn INTERNET. It never ever will be safe. Like, c'mon. If your child can't handle Roblox, maybe it's not the company's fault. It's not Roblox's job on how to teach your kid 21st century skills. They do what they can, but when it comes to issues born out of free-will, what the hell are they supposed to do? Your kid WANTS to buy this stuff, and if it's due to manipulation and targeting, then you need to teach him how to defend to against this shit. As long as free speech exists, manipulation will too. Connecting your child to the internet comes with huge responsibilities. You know that.

If you don't want to deal with this kind of stuff, then of course you can withdraw your kids from playing Roblox. If you believe that's the safest choice for you and your kids, then good for you. You're making the choices here.

I've said my piece. Have a wonderful day.",gifr7cg,gied12v

These simulator games have really taken a lot of creativity out of Roblox in my opinion, though there are some good ones.

I was excited for a lot of the new games coming, like Vesteria. But sadly it never worked out for them.

That's why we decided to make our own game. The game we are making is based on one of our childhood games, called Deadzone.. or Deadzone Remade.

He should stop crying about it and learn to cope/ not letting his frustration out on others. 

If you looking for tips to give him, there's how some mentioned ways to get Robux like Microsoft Rewards. To get more Robux a bit quicker I recommend using apps where you can earn money for playing games. I used Mistplay and and had enough points in barely a week to claim a 10€ play store card that I used to buy Robux. However it's something you need patience for (like anything else free) and you shouldn't expect too much Robux of it.
If he needs more Robux and quicker he should just buy himself Robux with his own  money
If he doesn't stop he seems like an overall annoying person I'd block. Also very immature of him to cry about Robux",j1h49id,N/A

I am really infuriated. Roblox refuses to reset my parental pin that I have set for my self. Now, here's the context:

My cousins and sister's accounts were being breached, so in fear of having my account breached, I created a parental pin. This was 3 years ago. Yes, I should have created a 2FA key; but, I did not want to go through the hassle of linking up all that jizz. My account age is <13, and my 10-year-old self decided to change the date to the date I created my account; it was created around 2012-2014. 

Now it's 2023, and I completely forgot the Pin. Roblox refuses to reset as they, ""do not reset pins upon user request"". Which is a lot of bull crap in my opinion. No where on the ""I Forgot the PIN"" Roblox page, does it state that they are not able to. I even mentioned my ""irl"" age, but the best they could do is, ""Roblox does not reset pins upon user request"". But of course! I can totally ask my parents who are refugees and totally know how to use a video game website! Even after informing my plight, Roblox refuses. I've sent over 4-5 tickets over the course of 1-2 years, and nothings changed. I've been honest and honesty seems to be the terrible choice when it comes to Roblox.

Yes, I admit, it was my fault as well. I should have created a 2FA key, or generated a backup code.   


And Roblox's rules are very vague. According to COPPA Regulations, a child is considered the age of 13 and under. No where on the Roblox page states who falls under the category for requiring a parental pin, nor any potential situations may face my similar plight.

I looked at the news the other day to find a news story about Pedophiles in ROBLOX.  It saddens me to realize that in the modern world we live in it is easily accessible for unsafe activity online. Roblox is the perfect place. 

Its younger player base as well as the fact that it is very is easy to grab kids attention. Whether it be by giving robux or offering in game items.  For example, in the ever so popular game collection of Pet Simulator, people just offer free pets through the trading option. They then add them and being talking. 

It is also very easy to fake your age, gender and name. For I have made and account which pretends me to be a 9 year old girl. I really hope roblox does something to stop these issues.

I have came up with a few ideas.  
\-Create an account limit to IP Address.  
\-Stop only thinking about monetary gain  
\-Remove the friends private chat feature all together  (If they wanted to chat they would do it else where)  
\-Add an age and gender verification system.   
\- Family settings and accounts ( Parent accounts look after and monitors friends and purchases...) Like the xbox feature.

Thank you

1. My family has one family computer. I have 4 siblings. What would be the limit? My mom had 11 siblings and they all had one family computer. If the limit is 10, then what? Someone (if roblox was around back then) wouldn’t get an account. So that’s a problem.

2. That’s capitalism. Asking a corporation to stop thinking of monetary gain is like telling someone to never think about eating. It’s not going to happen no matter how hard you try.

3. I use friends private chat to talk with multiple of my roblox friends outside of games. Just because you don’t use it doesn’t mean others don’t.

4. How would that work? How is a 9 year old going to verify their age? How would a 6 year old verify their gender? This most likely would not work and could lead to MAJOR lawsuits.

5. Roblox has those settings already for joining games. They can be set after a pin is entered, which the parents will usually have control of. This has already been implemented but the fact you’re posting that it should be shows it isn’t working.

I understand you’re trying to help and have ideas, I just don’t think it’s realistic to think this will happen anytime soon.",its7fzv,N/A

If you don't have the time, then your kid shouldn't be playing until you do have the time. You could even work while your kid is playing as long as you can see their screen at any point of time. This would prevent many things as young kids tend to fail at hiding things they shouldn't be doing. This also prevents misusage of technology. Cooperations won't put many prevention in place because how costly and time consuming it is.

Reply to point 1) The IP address was an idea which many other games use, Fortnite [Krunker.io](https://Krunker.io) and many more. If it were under my control then you would be able to apply for exemption and then more accounts could be made. 

2) Thats the problem with the modern world we live in- Most people put themselves before others. (The whole idea of Capitalism in my opinion).

3) I understand that but that is where the family settings would be able to verify friends and then chat. The whole problem is people adding randoms, talking, then talking elsewhere.

4) Your right, kids should be kids, they shouldn't worry about genders in the first place. Age though would be quite easy, send a picture and you would be able to tell the difference between and 11 year old and a 50 year old.

That's... completely false. Dynamic IPs are assigned when your modem connects to the ISP(and on the local area network when you connect your device to the router but that doesn't impact IP bans). You'll need to wait 5 minutes, if that.

>Kids are like that.

>But everything catches up with you. It only takes one wrong message for you to be reported.

Or.

A child, like I did, recognizes that less personal information on the internet is better, and remains anonymous.

Alternatively, they do get slapped with a ban from discord or whatever... and then they just make a new account and lie about their age again.

Happens to adults too; scam callers and emails are aimed at adults, usually. Makes me wish tech literacy and especially online safety was part of core curriculum, but something tells me I'll never see that happen.

>I have 11 classes in year 7 btw.

Goddamn. This is exactly what I'm talking about.

You'd need superpowers to juggle that many classes.",iturims,itspbfi

I am a father of a 9 yo daugher who loves adopt me.

I've read NewFissy make posts on here and clearly states the game is targeted for kids.

I play it occasionally with her, as it's actually not that bad of a game...but moreso to see how the kids go about it.

My daughter and kids love it and have a really good time playing together.

But it's pretty hectic, and I also kinda hate the develops for it at the same time. The second something new is released, my daughter, her friends and seemingly a majority of players in the game so ape shit for new stuff.

Like lately, a silly Ice Cream Truck comes in for 350 Robux. With au iTunes that's essentially $8.

Now, $8 isn't a whole lot for an in app purchase...but stuff like this rolls out regularly. Such young gamers are already getting addicted to in app purchases.

Yes, I am her parent and can simply prevent her from getting Roblox cards or iTunes cards, I know that. She will hate me for it...but I've taught her if you wait 2 weeks everyone seems to trade these 'old' items reasonably anyway.

Trading in Adopt Me is like supply and demand on crack, value of things change pretty quick.

Adopt Me also has another gaming demon, loot boxes. All of the pet eggs and even Robux purchased elements are all random. Such as buying golden fish and honey (I think that's what they are called, trying to 'win' legendary Bees & Penguins)

Our kids at such a young age are already being targeted for lottery based mechanics. 

Is anyone worried this is a bad thing for our kids?

Or just accept that's how gaming is now so sooner they learn about it the better?",N/A,N/A

Lootcates, micro-transactions, they are all very common in games across the board, in and outside of ROBLOX. As a player, these are very enticing, however there is a trick to saving your wallet--setting hard limits.

&#x200B;

Think about ROBUX as cash, set an allowance for how much she will recieve a month(or at any normal interval). Teach her that she should save some of her ROBUX each month(or interval of choice), and the more she saves, the more she will have to spend in case of new features and item releases.

Doing this will benefit her; it starts to teach her how to manage money from a young age and help her not live from paycheck to paycheck when she gets older.",fef93fz,N/A

I have two 16 year olds.  I put limits on their screen time and only let them play age-appropriate titles and when they would need to be disciplined, it was the first thing to go.  This fed the addiction and made unplayable games sought after at friends' houses which led to lots of deception and such.

Now I also have a 5 year old and never put limits on the games he plays at all.  He has a 3ds and switch and pc since he was 3 and spends far less time playing games than his brothers who are almost always on the phone, computer, xbox, etc.  My youngest son doesn't lie to play games or lie about the games he plays because he doesn't have to.  He played scary games and had nightmares for a few weeks and now doesn't like scary games.

The mentality is that most people who play a game want the full experience, they want to max their stats, and they want to know what completing the game feels like.

This brings about games that have no completion state, and that constantly add more stuff to be purchased to seem like stuff the average player needs for the full experience.

As a player, here is the criteria I use to decide whether or not to buy a particular in-game item:

1. **Is it permanant?** If you buy something in-game that can be depleted(currency, fuel, etc.), you are buying directly into will of the developer of that game, and fall into the category of player that generates the majority of their game's revenue. There is no edge-case for this type of purchase, it should be avoided unless you have money to burn.
2. **Do the benefits justify the price?** Unlocking extra game content(maps, gameplay, etc.) is usually worth it. Buying upgrades, skins, and lootcrates usually aren't. Upgrades and skins, because new ones *will* come out and then you *will* be compelled to buy those as well. Lootcates because the odds of you getting a more ""rare"" item is slim, and the purchasing of enough crates to actually land a ""rare"" item will definitely waste money.
3. **Am I going to play this game in a month from now?** This is a weirdly specific question that I ask myself. Usually the answer is ""I don't know, maybe!"". If the answer is anything but ""yes"", then I wait a month and find out before making any purchases. A game that I am going to get bored of after a month, a week, or worse only place once, is not a game I should invest in. Additionally, a free game that I can't have fun in for a month without making purchases is just a money trap.

Thanks for listening to my TEDTalk, I hope after reading you have more perspective on what constitutes smarter in-game purchases.

&#x200B;

Side note: Most people absolutely hate that last question and opt to skip it entirely. *They don't care if they are going to play the game in a week, or a month, they just want to buy stuff.* If the last sentence describes you, on behalf of all of the game developers in the world, thank you for your money.",feft1v6,fefi1mp

As long as your kid doesn't purposely go searching for inapropriate games, games on the front page of roblox are pretty family-friendly, maybe some anime games, maybe some generic RP games like adopt me, and at worst some gun games and maybe some blood splatter. If you are extremely harsh about what your child sees, I just encourage you to go check what they're playing from time to time. If you think the games they play are interesting, go and try it out.

I think you should play roblox with your daughter because you would be able to **friend her and see her activity.** This way you could see when she is playing, what she is playing. I think that is really important because not all games are safe for your child (such as sex games, yes there is sex games but they get taken down really quick).",gj1juce,N/A

Been playing roblox for ages on and off with a friend we are both in our twenties and we come back to it from time to time its ""old reliable"" and I feel I have some sound advice from the time we have played.

 Being honest not all of the games are bangers haha most of them are a cash grab for that sweet sweet robux but there are some hidden gems for sure some talented creators thrive on roblox so you will find something sooner or later its always great to find a competent game thats easy to enjoy and fun to play.

 The major concern as a parent is well we have seen some s#*t on some of the roleplay ""rp"" games for sure Id avoid those at all cost, for children especially, unless you are willing to give alot of time supervising them because many have uhhh ""adults"" prowling about for young and impressionable minds if you catch my drift... me and my friend always mess with these scum as hard as we can  most of the time its so obious it hurts, but not much can be achieved anyway because impressive chats censor system things crazy most of the worst words and slang as well as the abilty to give a adress is blocked a pretty well even more so on younger aged accounts.

Buuut on the other side of the coin its a great tool exercise social skills and with some supervision and a little stranger danger talk here and there alot can be learned and good practices can be exercised this way but regardless I think you can disable the chat altogether anyway.    

Id definitely recomend yall play together lots of things to do and play all for free more or less.",gj241e9,N/A

Good parts of ROBLOX:
You get to spend more time with your kid, which is great. There's a plethora of different games you guys can choose. I recommend playing Epic Minigames, as most people who play it are chill, and the Minigames are very fun. There's actually many great educational ROBLOX games. I know a museum game that gives lessons about wildlife and it's huge, I could go get the link for you if you want. Also, a decent chunk of the ROBLOX community are normal people.

The bad side:
Many people bypass things like inappropriate usernames, NSFW audio or images, and slurs or curses. It honestly disgusts me, as ROBLOX is meant to be safe for all ages.There's millions of user-generated games, but that doesn't necessarily mean a good thing. You wanna watch out for role-playing games, like Meepcity or Roblox High School, as they're infested with online daters. Also, there's bypassed games called ""condo games,"" which use scripts so that characters show up with reproductive organs & can have sexual activity. There are many edgy kids on ROBLOX but if they do anything too bad, you can always just block them so that their chat doesn't show up. Or you could just join a new server. Lastly, ROBLOX's security is by far, one of the worst ever. A friend of mine got banned from Roblox for saying ""oofers oofy,"" while people who play pornographic audio in-game are untouched. The report system is broken, and support/moderation never listens to you unless you're a YouTube content creator.",gj3eq3p,N/A

Hi guys. Not a Roblox-player, but a parent of two. Both under 13. Though I haven't played, I've heard *a lot* about it, as well as observed from the side. Failed at something; think I've got it figured out, but just want to check if I've got it right or not.

So we've been talking about making content of their own for a couple of days. Seemed like a good way to simultaneously introduce them to how things get value (eg. shirts cost because it takes an effort to make them), the technical side of it (how you make skins), as well as it being an artistic activity. Also, perhaps they could create stuff on their own instead of wanting robux to buy it.

I made an account to myself, just to check things out. Though I noticed shirts couldn't be uploaded for free, t-shirts worked without a subscription. Fair enough; at least it's something. We talked about what they could do, and not, without a subscription.

They spent some hours making an assortment of t-shirts. [...] But when the children attempted to access the upload page, it didn't work. 

A quick google search informed me that I had rushed into things too quickly; custom content is off limits for <13 accounts. *Sigh.* OK. **First question:** *I assume that is the case regardless if the account has a subscription or not?* In other words, the children are free to spend as much money as ~~they want~~ I let them, but they cannot upload content of their own, until they are 13? Even if they would buy a subscription, they would not be allowed to access the ""create"" page?

(Yes. I get that I could make >13 accounts for them. But for obvious reasons I'd like to avoid that.)

**Second question:** So let's say that I want to enable them, on their current <13 accounts, to use the custom t-shirts they have created. *Is my only option* (other than making additional accounts and lying about their age), *to (a) upload the content on my own account; (b) subscribe so that I can (c) put their content up for sale, which would enable the children to (d) buy their creations from me, so to say?*

... If so, it seems I'll also have to add the topic of exploitation to the introduction of capitalism. 😂

**Third question:** If it would work as described above, and I would subscribe for a month; upload stuff so that the kids could access it; they'd accessorise their avatars. *If I would cancel my subscription,* I assume they would still have the clothing available for their avatars but *would their stuff still be available for sale on my account or would it be taken off the marketplace?*

... Thanks for taking the time to read this far, and maybe even for helping me sort this out!",N/A,N/A

My clothing has been stolen multiple times, one of which is even being botted to this day.

Games I would suggest: Camping chapter 1, 2 and 3(story games), scp roleplay(roleplay game), generic roleplay gaem.(roleplay game, its actually funny and entertaining but would not be good if your kids want to play a serious roleplay game), Tower Defense Simulator(tower defense game), any existing tower defense game you can see when searching tower defense(Tower Battles if you want to team up with your children and compete against other players, but you will 99% lose when starting to play the game since the game is heavily based on the amount of time you played the game, otherwise just stick with Tower Defense Simulator), Facade(puzzle game), Find the Button(puzzle game)

Always play the games your children like(try different types of games with your children to know what they like), and avoid serious First Person Shooters(just some sort of gunfight games) unless your children really like those kinds of games since roblox avatar has a huge head and your children will most likely get 1 shot and gets angry. FPS games to avoid: Arsenal(0 co-experience), Counter Blox(hard), Phantom Forces(hard). Some FPS games are still fine though, most of the FPS games that doesn't have realistic graphics indicate that the game is pretty chill and toxicity-free. Avoid games with long games and is not 100% win(or at least high chance), since it would be really tiring and sad when losing.

Looking at your plugins tab does not necessarily show all of yours plugins. A plugin does not need to display a toolbar for it to be run.

For the vector3s, just capitalize the V.  
For services, and whatever tween info and goal are, you first need to go to the top of the script and put, for example, I'll use UserInputService:

`local UserInputService = game:GetService(""UserInputService"")`

Roblox knows that they can't directly moderate voice chat, and so do, well, voice chatters. The censor may be easy to bypass but it does work to an extent.

At the end of the day, Roblox is a magical free nanny parents leave their kids with to get them to shut up. That means they have, at best, a surface level understanding of what Roblox can and cannot do as far as moderation goes, without losing any capacity to create ruinous social media uproars. 

It's one thing to see someone messily bypass the filter as a parent, it's another for mommy to hear someone say the n word on little Jimmy's block game before they start sexually moaning. As far as the parent is concerned, Roblox did something about the former. They didn't stop the latter at all.

Roblox is rated E10+, meaning that only children ages 10 or older should be on the website.

People only target children on Roblox because they know there is a large surplus of underaged and naive users there. They wouldn't be nearly as large a problem if parents paid proper attention to the age recommendations.

If you wouldn't want your kid wandering around an arcade full of teens and adults by himself, then why would you trust the internet to babysit your child?

The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’. In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals.",is82e9q,N/A

Content is a mix of automated and manually moderated. Automation is applied to the things that \*can\* be automated, such as text. If you browse this subreddit for a while you may see lots of complaints about the filter being imperfect, which is expected. You can always turn text chat off completely.

Other uploaded content such as images, music, or things of that nature are manually moderated. Roblox may be a big company, but image recognition software is not perfect, so a human looks at every image, song, video, clothing, and more that are added to the site. I remember when they first added videos, that I had to sometimes sit there and watch all these 30 second videos back to back to back just to approve them. It was boring and awful.

The one major thing that is NOT looked at by a human are the games. They really can't prevent users from taking bricks and using them to spell out swears, or do other things like that. This is where they rely on user reports.

The main take away is that humans do most of this moderation, so things will always slip through. It catches 99% of bad content, but when a million items are uploaded each day, that means that 10,000 bad items make it through.",h75txy2,N/A

Tldr: found password for account from 2009 every old game I played is broken. When did this happen. Why.

Hello everyone!
This past week I was helping my parents move and they were tossing some old furniture. One piece was a huge part of my childhood, the computer desk. The inside drawer was full of my terrible handwriting and one thing written was my old Roblox password back from like 2009-2014. I was really bored and decided to hop on and see if I had any friends online or to see my old games I used to play (I only had one friend online).

After trying to play some of the older games that had the OG wand tool and explosion hammer and the stanper tool, I noticed a lot of them just didn't work anymore. The explosion hammer worked but then the paint bucket wouldn't or the stamp tool didn't work.

I’m a 19 year old female. I’ve been playing roblox since I was 13. I’m a quiet player, I don’t get involved in drama, I just watch and find it amusing because I used to be like that but I still enjoy the games. I’m still considered a “teen” in some respects but I am also aware I am a legal adult. Whenever a kid comes up to me and does something sus or says something sus, I just joke it off with “haha save that for other minors kid”. But then I get slammed with “imagine being an adult on roblox” “why are you on a KIDS game?” 

Just because it’s aimed to be safe for younger kids doesn’t say anywhere that adults are even discouraged from playing. It doesn’t really bother me when kids say this, because it’s obviously ignorant. But it happens so often I’m curious why people actually think we shouldn’t play?",N/A,N/A

My view of roblox has changed over the years yet i'm still as big a fan as ever. For some reason i keep on finding new things on the platform to enjoy when the stuff i used to play no longer has any appeal, it's almost like an infinite cycle...

When it comes to dealing with children, i gotta admit i hate kids, their stupid actions, and MY stupid actions when i was their age, it's a hatred fueled by regrets. In the scenario where a kid attempts to troll me, i instintively point out the facts and disprove whatever they throw my way, regardless if they are ignorant of it or not. Usually, this only happens when it's between me and only 1 other person, or if in groups, my sude will always have equal or more people on it. If i'm in a scenario with multiple trolls however, two things can happen. 1: If i'm just a normal player, i'll dip immediately, the rule of thumb is to never fight against a larger group. 2: If i am a GM, and the game disallows trolling, it's up to the punishment guidelines of said game.",hoi8sxo,N/A

My mom and uncles played video games with me growing up and they are some of my favorite memories. We’re a family of gamers I guess. Also, I know it’s aimed for kids but it also has things that attract adults. The voice chat for example I think should be 18+. And games like The Mimic I play with other adults and wouldn’t let my 6 year old play.",hoj232e,N/A

Keeping your imagination and wonder as an adult is normal and should be perceived more positively but a lot of kids think you have to suddenly be “boring” and “grown up”. I thought it was going to be like that when I was a kid. I’m 24 now and I got my mates into roblox too, half of them are older than me 27, 29 etc. It’s just a video game and these kids are too young to understand that they shouldn’t gatekeep a video game. Just ignore them. In time they’ll grow up and realize how dumb they were acting like that towards you otherwise ignoring them is the best you can do.

Part of it the distaste is on richer players almost always being adults, though I would agree, the negativity also comes from the pedophile stigma but it’s hard to explain to 6-12 year old that this is literally a community you’ve stuck around and helped build from the ground up since they were in their dad’s sack lmao.",hoj2vcx,N/A

The fact that ROBLOX is one community for multiple games feels like home to me.

On the topic of the post though, I have gotten little backlash for being 18. In fact, the open mic has actually helped me meet people who are older than me. Other than that, there is the usage of Discord and a lot of underage kids don't seem to mind I'm an older player. Of course, I don't consider myself their friends, but they might ask me to play a game with them and it's like having younger siblings. Any backlash you're getting from kids is immature or very cautious. The only comments I've seen are from parents themselves.

On another note (read at your own risk), >!ROBLOX has been targeted by many well-known pedophiles and it has been up to us to cancel them.!< Because of this reason, older people on ROBLOX are just a wary tale.

I think the problem is that *you* are still largely a kid. I imagine it feels weird to be othered when you’re still only 19. I remember feeling that way. I assure you it gets better as you get older and more acclimated to adulthood.

I started playing Roblox back in like 2016 with 2 of my oldest little cousins when I'd babysit them. Then they moved away and I started watching a few of my other little cousins and we started playing Roblox. We would play all the popular games, Adopt Me, Welcome to Bloxburg, ect. We would mostly stick to our self and if we did interact with anyone else the little cousins would take the lead and I'd just run off and do my own thing. In Bloxburg they would do some RPing with other people while I ran off and did some shifts of Pizza Delivery to build us up some money. I'd of course keep an eye on the chat and I'd be talking to them through PM to make sure everything was on the up and up. Now even they are older and I don't babysit them at all but I still enjoy playing Roblox on my own checking in on Adopt Me once in a while and seeing whats new, maybe take 15 to 20 minutes to hatch one of my eggs I still have, and think back to the fun times we had. lol I am actually working on my own Roblox Game as well.",hom6i72,N/A

For some, it’s the “creep factor” that comes with older players as it makes the younger players think we are weird (since some but very few players actually do try to hook up with younger players through places like discord) and all that shit as part of the reason, the others are due to the older players complaining about the updates (some of which I agree, suck and that time could have been spent elsewhere such as fixing a few fundamentals in studio such as making the arrow vehicle seat from 2012 work again, or fix the catalog and get rid of all the bot offers for example) and how it ruins the game they grew up with as opposed to the younger players who don’t understand as we came before them (a year or so ago during the bot infestation when they fucked over the catalog, someone posted that same topic wrote a thing saying they don’t understand why we were complaining until a lot of older players  told that user why they are complaining and why they are pissed at some of the updates)",hom70v1,N/A

Can confirm.

I've actually found a good amount of other adults (even substantially older than me!) who play a lot of the same games I do. We all, for the most part, seem to keep to ourselves and people-watch as opposed to being social but still enjoy the games.

There's no shame in enjoying games on Roblox even if you're 18+. Plus, if and when you have kids it's something you can do together that I would've killed for when I was little.

I don’t get why it’s so hard for people to wrap their head around some adults enjoy games, it’s free and has some quality experiences! When I play WZ I don’t even feel like I’m on roblox. But heck, I even play Minecraft and join other experiences like Outlaster and Piggy. They are really well made and FREE. Also, my son thinks it’s so cool that his mom plays with him and while I cringe when he tells his friends because their moms think I’m weird, I’m happy that it makes him happy. My mom and uncles played video games with me growing up and they are some of my favorite memories. We’re a family of gamers I guess.

With that in mind I’ve played the game 12 years and I’ve never had an suggestive “luring”encounter with any adult like that. 

I’ve heard some people argue against that with condos but as far as I’ve investigated the players that go to those places are curious kids that look it up on the search bar any find a copy-paste place that gets content deleted in like 30 minutes or (scarily enough) organized condos that you need to be verified, invited and vetted before visiting.",hoj4d33,hoi7vbc

The reason most teen developers make games on roblox instead of other game engines is because they simply cannot afford the servers and databases required to host multiplayer games. Plus, roblox provides a nice format and easy to read documentation.

Just because someone is a kid doesn’t mean they cannot make a successful game.

For instance, badcc, one of the creators of jailbreak, is 19. That means he created it when he was 17.",hp4ufc4,hp47sdr

No one really cares if an adult played a ""kids game"".  Or what he's a ""kids movie"", or reads a ""kids book.""

But when a child does an adult activity, it's more of an issue.  Because now the adult(s) in the space have to be aware of the child and what they say or what they do.

An adult isn't going to screw up their perception of the world by playing Mario Brothers, but a child is likely going to screw up their perception of the world playing GTA Online or COD and listening to a bunch of adults talking dirty things while shooting each other.",hot1bs2,hoklllu

So -- It seems that Roblox is making a big effort to get their development in front of kids.  They have a whole section of their website dedicated to teacher outreach including lesson plans.


My son, 7, is very into Roblox, and we spent a good chunk of today (his fall break) developing a Roblox game.  It's a ridiculous game, just a bunch of random prebuilt items over a weird terrain.  When I went to publish it, it is saying that the age restriction on it is undetermined.

I have his account locked down to the recent parental controls which only allows games that are suitable for all ages.  I caught him on some pretty questionable games, certainly not age appropriate.

When I went to the creator questionnaire, it told me that I basically need 100,000 plays to set the age restriction of my game.  That sucks -- so I either remove the parental controls on my 7 year old, or he can not play his own game that he worked hard on.

So -- is there some way to get around this not-being-able to set the age restriction myself, or some way to whitelist certain games that aren't in his permission level?  I'm really stuck here.  If anyone can help, we'd greatly appreciate it.",N/A,N/A

The ACS system is cool and all but the mechanics are super unnecessary for a game like Prison Life, the punching system is super basic and unreliable instead of using a raycast hitbox system which is 10 times better, the buildings are inconsistent some are super detailed and some literally looks like it was stolen from DooM this inconsistency problem is also a problem in the entire game.

Introduction of ""layered clothing"" which nobody uses simply because the normal clothing just looks better, fits better, is less complicated, and is more common having been around since the beginning of time   

The most popular ga...I mean ""experiences"", do seem to be either pet sim, brookhaven, murder mystery, and like 15 different anime fighting simulators that all the kids seem to like.

Egg hunts are over forever, seasonal events too. Events now are usually just sponsorships for brands or artists not many people care about with mediocre at best items for them.

The mobile ui, soon to become the pc ui, has become way worse as well. It will become ever harder to find specific items in the catalog due to the new ui not allowing specific prices to be looked up, and not having infinite pages (around 17 before it just stops, i believe)
Menus are confusing, but you'll get used to them.

Roblox added layered clothing like jackets and shoes, as well as some hair. These items are awful, as they dont fit well on actual roblox avatars, only rthro characters, and they dont work in R6.

The playerbase has become younger with a new surge of players who joined during the pandemic.

A majority of the top games now are click-to-swing-your-sword-and-get-strength type games with an anime coat of paint (i've seen a lot of one piece and jojo ones), people continue to create games like this because they're easy moneymakers and not because they have a unique, creative concept.

A lot of roblox developers and youtubers are beginning to come out as predators. Some hat creators have pornography on their main social media accounts. Shit's wild, and its the main reason why i dont buy items from certain creators.

If there's any positive things on roblox right now, it would be the new profile pictures coming soon, where you can pose your avatar using emotes and zoom in and out, the current bloxy event (which they changed the name to to sound more corporate) has some decent items to grab, and that many good games on the site still have a decent playerbase.",ihgeq1u,N/A

I'm not a fan of the exploiters in the slightest, it is usually messing with innocent people, but a lot of the kids thinks it is cool (it is usually the kids doing it in the first place). 

Be careful with exploiters, though. I have seen them do worse things than just teleporting players or flying around - it included loading extremely inappropriate pictures on the screen. I don't want to frighten you, but it is a warning, although I have only seen it once. I'm not one to tell you how to parent, but in my opinion, a kid being excited about getting together with exploiters usually isn't the greatest thing in the world.

They've been saying this for the past 7 years now and it's getting on my nerve. But how do I tell them that it isn't a virus?   
Every time I try and tell them that it isn't, they look at me as if I don't know what I'm talking about. I did my research.. There's around 60 million people registered on there, and mostly every friend I've asked and forum post I've gone on says that Roblox is safe! If it wasn't safe, then why are so many people and kids playing it?  


They only came to that conclusion of it being a virus after one of my grandparents old computers I played Roblox on had a virus, and connected the dots to conclude that **Roblox** = **Virus**.. which makes no sense because I've played it on my computer for about a year and had no issues. But I'm guessing they like to assume that kids break things and that it is Roblox's fault because I downloaded it.  


I'm asking on Reddit because I think getting input from other people might help me prove a point considering my parents believe everyone is wrong but themselves. If anyone has any tips to proving Roblox is safe, it'd be greatly appreciated!",N/A,N/A

Like the title says...sometimes my sons friends are playing and when they switch games he keeps auto joining their games. 

That’s nice for when they want to play together but sometimes he just wants to play his own game. He has two friends and they each sometimes keep switching games when they are each playing separately and he keeps getting bounced between both of them and he gets super frustrated.

My daughter signed up for Roblox when she was eight years old. Both my wife and I checked and the game seemed very age appropriate. And it is! It's child-friendly and lots of fun. My daughter has friends at school who play and they play together online. My daughters spent months building her account.

And my daughter is crying because of it and I feel like a rotten parent.

A friend came over and, without asking, signed my daughter out so that they could play. But my daughter doesn't remember her password. So when I contacted Roblox support and in their reply:

> To assist with or provide information about any account, we must first verify account ownership. Unfortunately, there is no email address or purchase information associated with the account. Without this information, we are unable to verify ownership or assist further with the account.

Naturally, my eight year old daughter doesn't have an email address or a credit card! But still, there response was actually very reasonable. We don't want account hijacking. But I can imagine quite a few parents in this situation. **However** ...

In July of 2019, Roblox sent _me_ an email stating that my child had signed up for an account and provided _my_ email address as the parent.

> Your child created the account XXXXXXXX on Roblox, an online entertainment platform that enables kids to _blah, blah, blah_.
>
> This email is to inform you that **your child has provided us with** a username, date of birth, and **a parent’s email address**. The parent’s email address is only used for account management, **password resets if the child forgets their password**, and to notify parents of changes to the child’s account access. To verify your email address, please click the button below:

Ah, great! This is what  I needed! I hadn't seen that email back then, but I was searching for anything about Roblox and found it. It also helpfully included a ticket number on the button to click to verify.

So I provided Roblox with this information, the ticket number, and I sent the email from the _the email address they sent this to_. They still refused, even though I'm supposed to be able to help her with a password reset.

When I again reminded them about the ticket number and that they could verify the information, they not only (again) didn't mention the ticket number, but wrote:

> Thank you for writing back to us.
>
> We're sorry but we're unable to provide you with any further information or response regarding this inquiry. We encourage you to review the previous information sent to you as we have provided you with all that we can at this time.

Some lazy damned support person can't be bothered to look up my details, even though I gave him the ticket number with the verification code.

I think this is a terribly shitty way to treat customers and my daughter's crying because of this. I've also tried reaching out to Roblox on Twitter, but I doubt that will get any response.

Sorry for venting. Just needed to get this out of my system.

I'm a parent and when my daughter wanted to create an account a couple of years ago I signed up with her and  have played with her and a lot happens in the chat that they try to censor, but people have definitely found ways around that to bully and harass. A lot of the more popular games get scammers and hackers, as well. So, please be very careful with your 8 year old on Roblox. You can go into the settings and turn the chat feature off.

Before then there are parent accounts(needed to enable full chat for 13<) where you can control your children's accounts. Dunno why they discontinued them, maybe they allow hackers to get on. If Roblox still has parent accounts it may save some headaches. And when parent accounts existed all forgot password email directed to parent's email if I recall correctly. Maybe that's why OP got such email because Roblox forgot to change the auto email content when they removed parent accounts. If yes they should change it",fi9w7ea,fi9seo7

Now when it’s 13+, everyone wants it to be 18+ again? If you play any other game, voice chat has these same issues, this isn’t just Roblox specific. Besides, this isn’t forced upon you. If you really dislike this feature don’t opt-in in the first place, or even better, mute them.

Another point I see is “Discord is better”. Yeah, you’re not entirely wrong, but the problem is Discord is on another application. I don’t think anyone would say they should take out Roblox in-game text chat because everyone should just use Discord’s text chat. It’s a hassle if you’re just trying to talk to people in the Roblox server you’re in. Imagine having to go to Discord and finding the right server everytime you wanted to send a message in-game.

Also, another side note your first point is kind of… weird? Voice chat is 13+, and it’s Roblox so of course you’re going to hear teens? I don’t know anyone that would expect to hear more adults than teens on Roblox.

I have also never seen someone using voice chat yet, and I have played a lot of roblox. Honestly even if it was 18+, you would still hear some pretty bad things. It annoys me how horrible and idiotic people are. I understand how maybe a kids voice could be annoying, but these people scream and play music through the mic, which just ends with ear bleeding static. also these kids are just absolute jerks. I just don't get this. I never see people like this online, and I sometime wonder what these kids grow up to be. 

2 note. Firstly, I know I said I never seen someone use voice chat in roblox. That is true. I know how all this feels from my experience in fortnite, which I am assuming is similar to what's happening in roblox. secondly, what you said about society, I am afraid we went of the deep end years ago. humankind is pretty much doomed.",hl3f8wf,N/A

Barely heard an actual adult"" You're acting like this ISN'T a kids game. If this is why you think Roblox VC should of stayed 18+ in a kids game... I don't know what to tell you. Are you like a 25 year old that plays Roblox 24/7 in your moms basement or something. ""I got called a ton of names and insults"" I think Roblox specifically made a FEATURE to mute people for a reason? Hm.. maybe in your head you must think its a feature just to be a feature and not be used. ""Got fun of for having ADHD"" I think you meant you got made fun of, but also... were you just going around saying ""LalalLAlalalala I HAVE ADhD lALALalla I jUst thouOugHt ALl OF you nEEded TO Know THAT"" like I don't think I go around stating all my mental illnesses, and I don't think you've gone outside much if you think people only make fun of your mental illnesses in Roblox.  ""My headphones constantly died because of a screaming kid"" I don't even know where to start with this one. I've never heard of headphones constantly ""died""ing, you can just mute them or turn your volume down... ""I've heard more racial slurs in ROBLOX than I have in real life"" That's because people don't go around saying racial slurs in real life considering people will bash them in real life but on Roblox no one can step up to them or hurt them for saying them, have you gone anywhere else that's not Roblox on the internet? Even in discord which I'm sure you know of you'll see tons of slurs from people behind screens which you can't confront. Again. Mute.",hlz1wyf,N/A

1. It's not ANYONES problem your 25 dollar laptop can't handle Discord and ROBLOX at the same time.
2. Use one on phone, another on ROBLOX.
3. When does voice chat in ROBLOX become handy for edgy 13 year olds who do nothing but say slurs?
4. Moderation for voice chat sucks. If you're going to have it, give it to 18 year olds.

I have two sons who I let play Roblox occasionally.  They are 10, and 7, and probably a little too trusting of friends.

Last night both of my kids were locked out of their accounts when I let them play before bed.  It would appear that one of their IRL friends was hacked, or scammed out of his account password, and then contacted my sons who trusted this person, and gave out their passwords.

We have since had a discussion about putting information out over the internet and sharing passwords, but their accounts are still in control of whoever this other person is.

I dont have much proof of their account, but I do know their in game names, and I have bought them in game currency before, and we also know the last password, so if anyone has any ideas, I would really really appreciate the help.  They are freaking out a little.",N/A,N/A

It's important to note though that ~~if~~ the customer service representative working with you approves your sons' accounts for a restoration (such as if items/robux were taken out of the accounts), they will only do so once for an account; this means that if either of your sons' accounts are compromised in the future, regardless of losing a significant amount more or less of items/robux, they will be ineligible for an item/robux restoration (they will however be eligible for assistance in retrieving a compromised account). Likewise, customer support has a 14-day limit on item/currency restorations. Although the link doesn't explicitly mention this, users on this subreddit have reported past successes in recovering accounts if they made purchases on them - with this in mind, I recommend keeping your payment information on standby but not providing anything unless asked. I hope that this helps!

My little girl loves Roblox, she's autistic and sometimes I'm able to get her to do things is to bribe (five bucks to have her let a hair stylist touch her is worth it.)

The past three days (July 2nd, July 3rd, and July 4th) we have been out of town with no access to her account. When we got back she immediately hoped on her account only to go into full meltdown, after an hour of calming her down, I discovered the issue.

The 275 robux she's had when left had dissappeared, replaced by a Pepino mouse shirt now worth 185 robux, purchased July 3rd when she had no access to her account, nor did anyone else.

How could this have happened? She is terrified she has been hacked, but why would a hacker just purchase a shirt?

When I didn't find a refund button and did some googling, I realised the chances of her getting refunded were unlikely, so I offered to buy her robux to replace the lost ones, but she insists it's pointless to have robux if her account is hacked.

Thanks to a YouTuber (I forget which, maybe itsfunneh?) she knows how to avoid the common scams and has even instructed me on how to as well. 

Any help with what could have happened and how I can reassure her her account is sfae now that I've changed the password?

I'm also confused how the hacker could of gotten her password? I am the only one who knows it, I didn't tell her.",N/A,N/A

There's a few possibilities, but here's a guess.

1. Her account password was weak and it got guessed.

2. She downloaded something that 'keylogged' her password.

3. Possibly she knew the password and accidentally fell for a phishing scam?(This is unlikely by what you stated, but I'm leaving this as a possibility.)

___

First of all, I highly recommend you to set up security settings on her account.


**Enable Two Factor Authentication** - https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/212459863-2-Step-Verification-Information 

**PIN** - Through [settings](https://www.roblox.com/my/account#!/security), you can enable a separate PIN inside of your account settings to prevent unwanted changes to your account settings.

**More secure password** - Secure passwords are difficult to guess, have long lengths with mixes of capital letters and uncommon keys(e.g @#$%^*&). You can also use a [password manager](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/877c10/looking_for_password_manager_recommendations/) to handle your passwords for both your Roblox account and other sites.

**Never give away your account details.** - There is almost no situation where you can reasonably give away your account details. Roblox staff will never need access to your account. Always check frequently when clicking links whether you are on the official Roblox website(www.roblox.com) before entering any account details.

**Beware of off-site downloads** - Off site downloads can contain malicious content which steals your account details. Be wary when downloading anything from untrusted sources, especially sketchy forums promising 'free' or 'paid' cheats/hacks for games. This includes browser extensions.

___

Aside from that, Roblox has a ton of security options that should prevent this in the future. Above are the examples(2FA, PIN, etc) which would make it much easier. There's also an option on the settings to log out anyone that isn't your device/computer in the settings panel.

You can also contact roblox support for help -  https://roblox.com/support

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. We get a lot of parents on the sub who are confused on what to do, and most of us are happy to help.

Something like this has happened to me before.

On the 4th of July, 2018, my Roblox account was hacked by someone unknown. They purchased Robux on my account (I knew that because when I checked my Robux, the balance was up to 123 to 943). Later on, I accessed Roblox again and saw that my account was deleted for unauthorized/disputed charges. I emailed Roblox Support as quick as possible. Some hours later, I received a reply saying that my appeal has been sent to a billing specialist who will be able to assist me further.

After 6 days of waiting, I finally received a reply from a billing specialist saying that my appeal has been denied. When I read the message, I was completely clueless since ”one or more of the purchases made to this account were reported as disputed/unauthorized by the card owner through Google Play.“ 

I had absolutely no idea what that meant since the card holder is clearly me. What I assumed happened is that the hacker purchased Robux on my account with a different card so Roblox saw the charges is unauthorized and terminated my account. 

The question is... How did they assume such a strong password? The hacker could have possibly keylogged my Roblox account. After some weeks later, I finally received another message from Roblox saying that my account has been unbanned. Later on, I activated 2 step verificafion so something like this won’t happen again.

I also forgot to mention that the hacker left a message on my account. ”This is what you get.“",e4a7szq,N/A

why on earth does roblox let experiences with blood/gore, horrifying or disturbing images, realistic weaponry and suicide attempts (in talking about YOU broken bones) on their platform???


i dont know what to say about this honestly. its just a bit shocking, knowing that the target age for this game is around 8 years old and they can be exposed to experiences with those pretty horrendous things. i remember being a 9 year old kid, going to roblox.com to play Meep City and then I see an ad with a disturbing image with a creature with dark eyeless sockets and bloody teeth??? someone tell me how this is appropriate for a platform for 8+ yr olds??? anyways i ran away from my laptop (no kidding) and stopped playing roblox for like a month. that was literally one of the most terrifying moments of my life.


this isnt only just on ads too. experience thumbnails also contain disturbing content and those recommended games are often unavoidable. also why does neighborhood war exist??? this has to stop.


sorry if i sound like a parent (im not) but i really dont want kids traumatized by logging onto roblox. and if those ads dont go away, im gonna make a suggestion here: **make experience age ratings restricted to -13 or +13.** 


for example, if an experience contains bloodless mild violence, images that are a little bit scary or low level swearing then the developer should give the experience either a 13- or a 13+ rating. if an experience contains intense violence and/or blood, frightening images and PG rated language it should be restricted to 13 and up. also not sure if this exists but if it doesnt make a filter that prevents you from seeing different types of content.


anyway im done ranting. hope the roblox mods will take this into consideration. cya",N/A,N/A

However, there is a large audience of people 13+, with that being said there will be games to entertain these groups. Roblox has advised parental guidance for users under 13, and they moderate games that push the line of Mature. 

From the post you made I’m going to assume that you’re of a young age, so my best advice is that you take caution into the games you’re joining. Most games will have a blood warning, however there are games which could obviously have blood and or slight gore. (ex: shooters, horror games or intense rag doll games) Look up a game you’re uncertain about and you will 100% see if there is something you might find disturbing. 

Please remember that with Roblox being an open-publish platform, it will fall to the same consequences of the rest of the internet where there will be very disturbing experiences, however you really have to look for these kinds of things. Just tread lightly. 👍",ifcmce7,N/A

If you're generally concerned about interactions with other players, there is the option to turn on ""Privacy Mode"" which basically blocks all interactions with her account, save for a set of pre-selected phrases. There's more info [here.](http://www.roblox.com/Help/Builderman.aspx?id=21320047)

If you don't want to limit her interactions with other players (turning on privacy mode turns off private messages, on-site chat, and a bunch of other stuff she may use to talk to other players that she makes friends with) then just keep on doing what you're doing: watch what happens and make a judgement call.

As for security, there's never been any issues with the game itself doing things to a computer. It's mostly just people downloading stuff for ""free Robux"" and things of that ilk, which it seems like your daughter is smart enough not to do.",c9dnhfq,N/A

Roblox does its best to prevent this, with 24/7 moderators constantly moderating content on the website and reviewing reports. However, some content does slip out and is visible - take [this](http://i.imgur.com/R5Y9dmk.png) for example (note that if it does *slip* through, it'll get moderated eventually. Usually within 10-30 minutes).

The online-dating thing isn't much of a *big deal*, players aren't sharing private information such as street address or even hometown - however it is against the Roblox rules and it's as simple as instructing your daughter to report the player.

We don't want you to think of Roblox as a bad thing from the responses you're seeing here. ROBLOX actually is advertised as a building game to help kids learn programming and creating their own games.

There is no direct bullying involved with the community when a user has safe chat enabled, because essentially the player can not see what anyone else is saying, however-

Safe chatters are simply called out as a ""safe chatter"" behind the ""safe chatters"" back, just for being a ""safe chatter"". If that makes sense.

I'm actually quite glad you have decided to disable safe-chat, because another big aspect of the game is socializing. When your daughter sees that Roblox is actually a big economy with users trading hats, selling hats, and trading Robux/Tickets, a lot can be learned from interacting with other players and making new friends.

There are two currencies used in ROBLOX; Tix and Robux, which are both exchangeable at around a 1:18 (robux:tix) rate. You get 10 free tix every day you log in, and Robux is the payed currency. With Robux you can purchase a lot of cosmetics, whereas with tix your choices are more limited and you have to save for longer. There are a few games where you must pay Robux to gain access, but most are free-to-play.

To conclude, I believe your son can enjoy ROBLOX without the need to spend any money on it.

EDIT: A recent blog post announces the removal of tix, now the game will only utilize Robux as a currency. This shouldn't mean much for a player who didn't intend to spend money, they might even benefit as free cosmetic items will be released.",d0ycfe2,N/A

Yes, there is some levels that you have to pay. But that is in-game currency. If you can't afford to play thoses levels, there is alot of free levels that can be actually pretty cool. 

> How is the pay structure for this game is it just for cosmetic items or do you need to pay for the levels etc?

You pay for cosmetic items and also gears (which kinda are used more for cosmetic purposes, because many games doesn't allow gears), but they shouldn't affect gameplay that much. You also can pay for levels, but most of them (around 80%), are free to play. Another thing that costs money (in-game currency at least), are gamepasses. Some might give you advatange in the game, while others are also cosmetic.

So in short, there are games that you have to pay to play, but there is ALOT of cool games that are free as well. The currency in gam can be used for alot of things: buying levels, cosmetic (hats, pants, shirts), gears and also gamepasses.",d0ybnkr,N/A

Roblox is a game platform(think steam), so gift cards would add something similar to steam wallet for him to purchase stuff like games/microtransactions on the app/site. 

So for your situation, there isn't much you can do without emails. I guess create a new account and set it up for him(as long as there isn't anything of value on his previous account he should be fine).

Unless you have any additional proof(billing info/previously used gift cards, etc) there isn't much if he doesn't have access to his password or email.

Prequalifiaction: All I know about Roblox is what I've found via google since my 7 y/o daughter finally browbeat me into installing Roblox onto her tablet.  She started playing this, and we enabled the <13 parental controls, and go in and clear out her friends list and repeat to her daily ""you're too young to make friends on the internet.""

Thing is, I noticed the other day she was playing Meeps (test) which from what I can gather is a test version of the more popular MeepCity game?   Anyways, in this game, she has a completely separate friends list, and the parental restrictions on chatting are completely circumvented as the app has it's own chat system.

Am I crazy, or is this a blatant glaring hole in the parental controls philosophy?  

Also, it looks like the parental controls don't allow her to play MeepCity, but somehow the test version is okay? 

Can someone explain to me what I might be missing?  I don't mind her running around in silence in the game, but I'm just not ready for her to socialize with strangers online quite yet.",N/A,N/A

(sorry if the flair's wrong, I can change it.)
So I wanted to impress my parents with the money I made on this game, but I'm afraid I won't be able to cash out with Dev-ex until I remove the right-to-erasure claims. 
I wanted to remove the original 1 or 2 claims, so I did what the official dev-forum post said... and for this I enabled data stores because I thought I had to. I did everything on the page and it did nothing. 
Then I got like, 5 more claims. I think enabling data stores made it worse. Or it might be this admin thing I put into my game, but I don't know how to delete data from that. When I deleted the admin and in a later update added it back due to complaints, the data remained.
I also read that just deleting the game and putting all the content into a new game (except for data stores obviously) would work? If I wanted to cash out, would this work?

Security + boring parent question. (I really need some help; please hear me out.)

My foster (soon to be adopted) son plays Roblox with his biological brother, who is in another foster home. I have absolutely no control over that other home, and I know that they have very little grasp of technology in general. My son’s account is set appropriately to his age, which is 12. He has only a few friends allowed in his account, and I routinely monitor his activity. (Because of a significant history of trauma, abuse, and neglect, his functional age is much lower than his chronological age, and poor judgment is a major concern.)

His brother has very little supervision with games (despite the same trauma history), and I have no idea if his account is set up as a <13 account. (He is 11.) I heard him say on the phone today that he has “100 friends.”

(I’ll give you all time to stop laughing before I continue. Lol) I work in healthcare IT but I am NOT a gamer. I’m 50. I’m OLD.

Can “over 13” accounts interact with “under 13” accounts? Is 100 friends excessive for a kid who’s 11? 

Any other tips, thoughts, etc., are welcome.

Thanks!",N/A,N/A

accounts that are under 13 are forced to be secure. they have a stricter filter ingame and in most cases are only allowed to communicate with friends.

on an unrelated note, there is a part of the playerbase (not sure how large but i would say possibly 10%) that have cheats and some of them are able to use them to do inappropriate things. i wouldn't say it's very common to see it happen, i've seen maybe it 2 or 3 times and i've been playing for over 8 years. the security against them has kind of cracked down on them but there's still a few of them going around sometimes. the popular games that are found on the front page are generally free of them.

Also remind him to not put personal info on the chat as well.

Once the account becomes 13+, it can access 'Social Links' to websites like Discord. Keep in mind that everyone there will be 13+ unless some <13's lie about their age. These Discord chats will be about the ROBLOX game or the group that they are connected to so you shouldn't have to worry too much.

100 friends is **not too excessive** because most 9-11 year-olds have maximised their list to 200 friends at that time. What most friends do is just follow each other into game and realise: 'Oh wait, I friended this person, ok whatever.' But what some people do is if they find that a person is good at being a duo or some people is good at being group, then they might friend the other people, so they can play together some other time. 

There are such things as private conversations which both <13 and 13+ accounts can access. The ROBLOX software automatically creates a new one with every new friend. This is used to chat without having unwanted players in it. There can also be a chat group which has a maximum of 6 players (They all have to be friended to the person who started it). You can change the name of the group as well, but it is filtered, as well as the chat itself (Filtered messages will not be sent).

\+13 and <13 can communicate, 

100 friends is not too excessive,

So basically, the script is saying the walk speed is 5 and it takes 0.5 seconds to ease into the walkspeed 16. How would I add something to the script that uses:

&#x200B;

    		script.Parent.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = script.Parent.Humanoid.WalkSpeed + 0.5
    		if script.Parent.Humanoid.WalkSpeed >= 16 then
    			script.Parent.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 16

&#x200B;

20 would be run speed, and you would have to use enum.key to tell it when to change it into the run speed, the key would be shift. So, you hold shift and it eases from 16 to 20 just like it did from 5 to 16. I kinda suck at coding and I'm kinda stumped on this. Thanks!

&#x200B;

Full script, goes in StarterCharacterScripts:

&#x200B;

    while true do
    	wait ()
    	if script.Parent.Humanoid.MoveDirection == Vector3.new(0,0,0) then
    		script.Parent.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 5
    	else
    		script.Parent.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = script.Parent.Humanoid.WalkSpeed + 0.5
    		if script.Parent.Humanoid.WalkSpeed >= 16 then
    			script.Parent.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 16

Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/ry66r8/constant_harassment/,Constant harassment,LeilaSP,2022-01-07,1641558011.0,118,"Constant harassment
Me dealing with bullying isn't seldom. Even if I attempt to start a chill topic, it ends in vain. I'm either thwarted from enjoying the game because of my sex or my race, I'm watching somebody else get harassed due to their neopronouns, I beat somebody in Arsenal or MM2 fair and square and they get salty, or somebody decides to recklessly exploit.

Last year, I had endured an estimated SIX death threats from six different users telling me to ""die"". I block them? They call me a snowflake and/or make multiple accounts and launch them all simulatenously using third-party applications. Even if I can't see what they say, it still irritates me mentally. I'm telling you that it happens over and over, person after person, and sometimes its a scenario where I find stuff like this hard to ignore, mainly because of how extreme the topic is.

If I'm confronted and I question their contemptible behavior, they use a victim mentality and/or project their own problems onto me during the argument. An example of this was a time where I was accused of being transphobic due to be being oblivious to the fact that the people who accused me weren't female despite having a 3.0 body, and that I was referring to them as ""she"". Meanwhile, they called me the f slur word for wearing a rainbow polo shirt and the c word for being white. They also stated that you can't be racist to white people.

To digress, last night I was jumped by seven different people, whom the ""ring leader"" was a user with black hair and the ""meanie"" face. They spewed out racist, demoralizing and risque remarks and ridiculed my avatar. They also insinuated that my parents working as strippers was their bread and butter, and that I should be ashamed.

What I did in response was deny everything they said about me and questioned whether they were even okay in real life. But then afterwards, the argument ended with them spamming ""ratio"", ""L"" and claiming that they ""won"", despite the fight being quite one-sided. Even so, after the argument, the leader of the pack came back to me several times.

After the argument, I exited the ROBLOX client and went to my avatar page to find out that I was WARNED FOR MENTIONING COVID-19 PRIOR TO THE ARGUMENT. Talk about double standards. I could be wrong on this, but I suspect that it was the same seven individuals who decided to spam report me.

I promptly got off and decided to relax myself by watching a Season 1 rerun of SpongeBob on Nicktoons. After SpongeBob finished, I pulled out my phone on my way to my bedroom, went to my Discord DM's to see that my friends sent me screenshots of the FULL ARGUMENT in action.

To conclude, I feel like i'm someone entering a life of crime given the amount of drama I face, like a notorious fugitive wanted by several other users. Weird analogy but, do you guys have any other tips for circumventing this type of behavior besides reporting and blocking? I feel like those procedures are tedious and futile, and that it can backfire on you for no reason at all.",N/A,N/A

Not that all kids are like this, but the most idiotic voices tend to be the loudest. That being said, if they're following you around and harassing you, it might be in your best interest to change some of your privacy settings, like who can join you. And if people are doing this, absolutely block and report them. That's what the mechanic is there for.

To the OP I'm just guessing your on the younger end of the demographic and I would just say to not take this too personally that you shouldn't let a bunch of random people over the internet ruin things for you.

But I won't get on my soapbox for what I think is wrong.

Hey sub, 

Not sure if this is an OK question for this group but I'll try. My 9 yo loooves Roblox, and I [36 n00b] am starting to warm to it and I've made my own user. We've spent a couple of R$ on silly crap like wings and cooky non-bacon hair. It's a fun way to play and communicate with friends. I’ve put some time into learning the ropes - controls, avatar options etc. We often have kids here after school playing together on the couch. Others join from their homes. 

What are some games we can enjoy together? 

I'm looking for games that are fun for a group of kids and parents, at an 8-14 yo level. So far we're into things like Hide and seek extreme, pretend high school games like Royal Heights, dress up (ie Fashion Famous), obbies and Sims-like games like Adopt me or Meep city. I like when they have to use their brains a little, not *just* apply shooting or lipstick. 

Any recommendations? ",N/A,N/A
comment,https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/b4me9a/games_for_kids_and_parents/,N/A,DementTheJuiced,2019-03-23,1553380964.0,7,"A couple of my recommendations are similar to some the games already suggested, though a bit different in some aspects. I'll start with the similar ones:

* Lab Experiment. Pretty similar to Horrific Housing, but lab-themed, less meme-y, more players, more events that happen (like, say, a tree grows on your platform, or maybe your platform turns black and the same event happens twice, or you turn into a cat or your head grows), the rounds take a bit longer, random bosses, and with slowly rising lava to add some peril, along with minigames in the lobby to help you wait for the next round.
* Dungeon Master, a slightly-less talked-about game nowadays, but as I recall, people still play it. Similar to Epic Minigames, but I'm pretty sure it has less minigames and some of the minigames have similar objectives to one another, e.g. survive the boss and complete the obby.
* Cleaning Simulator. You play as vegetables/fruit and clean a building using various tools (well, only two if you don't count the golden mop and the red spray bottle, but you get my point). There's this neat boss at the end. Has a lot of secrets. Might get boring, but it might not.
* Whatever Floats Your Boat. You build a boat, and you survive the storm in your boat. There are teams you can make, and you can work together in said teams, building boats and destroying enemy teams.
* If you want to experiment on each other, the Innovation Laboratories (including Innovation Labs, Innovation Inc. Spaceship, and Innovation Arctic Base) are the places to go. Just, uh, watch out for when the core eventually blows up or freezes over and if you want, get to safety. There's no actual consequences if you *don't* get to safety (apart from Innovation Inc. Spaceship, where you get sent to limbo, then sent back), but y'know. Speaking of which, in the Spaceship, if the core is going to freeze over, I suggest heading to the oxygen chamber. The escape pods'll work too, you just won't get to see a neat little light show. (The oxygen chamber won't work for the core meltdown though.)
* If toilet humor is a thing you might enjoy (and/or allowed), there's a fun little game called Fart Attack. What basically happens is you run around the arena (which is in a toilet bowl) and collect enough beans (and burritos, which fill your fart meter faster than beans) to fill your fart meter enough to blow your opponents away. There are special abilities you can use and unlock to give yourself an advantage in the arena, and there are also boss rounds which happen from time to time, where it's basically the same thing, except instead of blowing away opponents, you work together to throw toilet paper rolls at the boss.
* If you're tired of doing other things and just want to make some computerized cakes, then I'd suggest Make a Cake: Back for Seconds. It's a game where you make cakes by putting the materials on conveyor belts and either feed it to a giant noob (yes, you heard that right) or you can eat the cake yourself. You get points over time and can spend those points on in-game items like a block of pure sugar, or one of those gaming systems that you can play in the game. There's also a few other things to do with the cakes you make, like performing experiments on them or making one your pet that follows you around everywhere. If you're tired of making cakes, you can always try and beat the high score on one of the two short obbies, or maybe feed the giant noob one of the trucks, or just let the giant noob eat *you.* 
* Want to experience the Titanic in Roblox? Then Roblox Titanic is the place to go! It's, uh... the Titanic. You try and survive the Titanic sinking. There's also roleplay tools if that appeals to you. One thing to do here is to try and survive on the iceberg, you get a badge if you can do that. Just be careful not to slip.
* If you like being a superhero and having a secret identity, then Super Hero Life III is probably the game for that. You can either play as a superhero or a supervillain that you make (like, you can make the character, the suit, you can choose the powers, pick the name, make a backstory, all that) and fight the other team and you have a secret identity that you can change into (you make the secret identity along with the hero). You need credits (or whatever ingame currency it's called) to unlock more things for your hero, and you can do that by doing one of the two jobs available right now, and how much currency you get is how many rounds you last on the job, where you need to keep everything from being too high or too low in order to keep going.

You know what, I think I'll stop here. I'll leave this here with this: If it seems interesting enough, try it out. It might be on the popular page, it might be somewhere further down the page. Heck, it might even be in the ""friend activity"" list. And, if you don't think it's for you, then that's okay.

&#x200B;

...I feel like I should end this with something. Some sort of inspirational paragraph about following your dreams, or maybe a signature.

Can't think of anything, though, so I'll just leave it as it is. 'Sides, it probably wouldn't fit anyways.",ej886yp,N/A

I have a wall with in my game where you can go through it with a ""keycard"" (stonepick) aka like breaking the wall open. To get the stone pick you have to have 5 items and once you have the 5 items you can buy it from the shopkeeper. The tool is stored in replicated storage, and is copied to the backpack. Everything works untill i get to the door where if I walk to it with the stonepick it doesent open BUT if I put the stonepick in my starterpack it opens and no fix???

Script for the wall:

script.Parent.Touched:Connect(function(hit) if hit.Parent.Name == ""StonePick"" then

    script.Parent.CanCollide = false
    script.Parent.Transparency = 0.5
    wait (2)

Roblox is one of those platforms based around user-made creations, and so it has to deal with the upsides and downsides of being a user-made platform, and these downsides are especially apparent when you factor in Roblox being geared towards children. Some users will purposefully make obscene and unwanted content that children will end up finding on the site, and Roblox does their part by having moderators come and delete these places. You will also find people using the chat features of Roblox to harass or molest children. This isn't to say that these are common occurrence on Roblox, as these represent the worst of the worst players, a very small percentage of players. My point is that these downsides that the parents are blaming on the Roblox staff and moderation teams aren't faults on Roblox's part, and they are inherent downsides of the type of platform that Roblox aims to provide. Parents need to do their part by ensuring that their children know about online safety measures such as what information not to give to other users through Roblox and the internet rather than simply throwing a tablet at them and letting the tablet babysit their children.

Seriously? No, not everyone is a pedophile, but parents aren't upset by people ""saying hello"". They're upset by things like older boys creating scripts to literally rape people in-game- something that happened to me a few times some years back. It's been fixed  now but I know it happened to a lot of other people, mainly young girls. 

While Roblox has definitely gotten better at getting rid of explicit content such as the rape scripts and sex games, that does not negate all of the other harassing behavior teenage boys take place in. It's also not uncommon for older boys and men to befriend young girls (grooming) and start asking for their facebook, insta, discord, etc. Stop pretending it's just ""saying hello"" or ""being insulted"".",ectzj5a,N/A

I am getting sick and tired of seeing hashtags in games for things that there shouldn't be a hashtag for. Like ""125 Requesting Tow to Zip 211 212 for a burned down ambulance."" will get mostly hashtagged for no reason. The hashtag thing is old and completely broken. Either they need to do one of 3 things. 1: Completely rework the hashtag system so it checks each individual word then the whole sentence and only hashtags words or phrases that should be hashtagged. 2: Completely remove the hashtag system and make it so that it is like all the other online games where they just have to put a warning that chat may be mature. 3: Add an option for accounts that are 18+ gets the hashtags completely removed. Like how they have it for 13+ accounts but for 18+. Either way. It is broken and rediculous.",N/A,N/A

Hi. I have very minimal scripting expertise and am trying to edit a script for a project I am working on.

(Learning Lua, Parents Guide, Etc.)",c0mmandhat,2018-06-04,1528145635.0,45,"Poll: Create Dedicated Wiki Pages For Common Requests? (Learning Lua, Parents Guide, Etc.)
Hi! I'm making this sticky thread independent of the rest of the mod team for a couple reasons:

1) All of the moderators seem to have different opinions on the wiki; for example Pikalyze has created a dedicated F.A.Q page with help from the community, but it's not linked anywhere useful, and covers some topics more then others. On the other hand, we have multiple pages for linking cool places that people should play, but all of them were abandoned and have gone unedited for 6+ months.

2) The subreddit could benefit from having some dedicated wiki pages to deal with some recurring (but not common) topics, such as cool games to play, or learning resources (*other then the dev wiki*) that would help get you started.

I'd rather ask regulars of the subreddit whether they think this change would help clean up the front page, as those are the people who would benefit most from this change.

Here's what I think:

***Pros:***

* (slightly) decrease the amount of self posts that appear on the front or rising pages.

* Dedicated help pages for those finding us via search engines.

* Better, and more available, help resources for those who need it.

* The ability to highlight upcoming devs who are unable to get themselves Featured.

***Cons:***

* Pages would require being updated from time to time as links go bad and resources move around.

* Naming individual contributors would be difficult and would clutter up the wiki.

* Pages about good games would be subject to individual opinions, potentially causing unwanted scrutiny.

Along with the question of focusing on the wiki itself, we also have the question of where to put links, so these pages can be located without some detective work. Some sample locations:

* **A small link along the top of the subreddit front page.** This would be a good place for visibility, but would look like an announcement instead of a reminder that the wiki exists.

* **On the /submit page, along the top.** This would probably be a better place, but would feel rather ""forced"" and would use screen space on a major page that would go largely ignored after a few months.

* **A (permanently) stickied post, like this one.** This is probably one of the worse ideas compared to the others, as we have already had a bunch of moments where we needed two stickies and limiting ourselves to one would not help.

* **Along the sidebar.** This *could* be (and probably is) the best place, but we already have a ton of regular visitors who either never read it, or barely touch the significant amount of links we already have placed there.

----

*I'm also going to leave a small reminder that we, as the subreddit, have our own [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/W7yHfhW) where we hang out. It's a great place to quickly contact the subreddit mod team, find answers to quick questions, even drop some memes. Sometimes a verified developer will drop by and chat for a while, which can make for interesting conversations. You'll need to link your reddit account and wait for us to verify you before you can join the discussions.*

There are other subreddits who definitely use wikis to a great effect(e.g writingprompts), and Roblox has enough content for studio/website to have at least a basic setup for a wiki.

Besides, we're also constantly being bombarded with 'MY ACCOUNT HAS BEEN HACKED' and similar that it would be easy to just make a guide on-hand rather than repeating the same stuff to people over and over. Situations vary, which is fine(and people can try to assist instead of linking the wiki), but cleaning up the wiki goes a long way.

The proposal, as least as I am proposing, is to create pages that cover more generic posts that can be answered in a ton of different ways: [One](https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/8o3mu6/quick_question/), [Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/8oi4vu/best_programmingscripting_references_or_tutorials/), [Three](https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/8nherd/any_way_to_make_my_game_more_popular/).

These are *not* support posts, which are better answered with tailored replies specific to your situation.

Take link one: A parent, trying to figure out Roblox, what it's about, and if it's safe. Well, if we had a link marked ""For Parents"" or ""Parents Guide"" that had detailed, specific answers that would resolve these questions, then such a post would be answered before even being created.

Link Two is someone asking how to learn lua, which is a generic question that can be answered easily. Our current ""resource links"" are [noticeably light and mostly refer to official resources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/8oi4vu/best_programmingscripting_references_or_tutorials/e040zyf/) If we had a larger page dedicated to this, we could highlight individual people who create Studio tutorials, not only on scripting, but also on building or other ways to use Studio.

Link Three is someone asking how to become a popular game. Again, there are a variety of already known ways to become popular, most of which are easily executed but either see little use or are superseded by more difficult methods just because they're more immediately visible. A wiki article on this can fix that by clearly showing all possible methods to increase popularity and returning player count.

**Note that I'm not going to remove topics that come up just because they have a matching wiki article -- I don't plan to use the wiki to moderate, other then linking to the rules on posts that break them.**",e0477vp,e045yys

Have the game detect if these models fall past a certain X & Y coordinate, and if that is the case, use some form of teleport command to return them onto the ground.

Just keep in mind that there isn't really a sure-fire way to check if something has been destroyed, any script can set the Parent to be `nil` and then back to workspace or w/e.

Here's a script you can put inside the model you want to ""respawn"" when it gets destroyed:


	local model = script.Parent

	local modelParent = model.Parent
	local modelClone = model:Clone()

	script.Parent = game.ServerScriptService
