&#x200B;

Got a message from her teacher today; LO just turned 5 in January. Teacher said LO was stirring her yogurt but not eating it (not terribly surprising to me) but we do usually stir up the yogurt before eating it. Teacher assistant asked LO if she was done and LO smarted off to her. 

&#x200B;

Teacher also mentioned she hasn't been playing/speaking nicely with her friends lately. 

&#x200B;

LO has been suffering from upper respiratory stuff since forever, we had her on a medication that was supposed to help deal with the symptoms but there was some recent research out that said some kids may suffer from side effects - depressed mood, etc, so we took her off of it. We hadn't noticed TOO much but she has been defiant / rude to her grandmother, who is her usual caretaker during the week when we're working. 

&#x200B;

Her little brother recently turned 1.5, and has been a handful, so he's getting a lot of extra attention of course, because of the fact that he's a toddler. I'm sure that's playing into it. 

&#x200B;

To be 100% truthful, she gets too much screen time. YouTube - usually gaming channels and family vlogs, I haven't seen much of what she's watching that is directly objectionable - and her tablet/Roblox on the laptop.

&#x200B;

After discussing with her mom what we should do, we've decided that less screen time and some time devoted exclusively for her each day should help. Personally, I'm fine with 100% cutting her off from YouTube, and overall restricting her (and our, to be fair,) screen time down to a more reasonable level. It's hard with her little brother, but they're worth the effort. 

&#x200B;

Do you have any other suggestions to help out? Experiences?  Our overall plan is, as stated:

More dedicated one on one time for her

Less screen time overall

She is getting better about it, but it used to be really bad. She would sneak my daughter (Kylee 12) candy and treats and stuff her full of all of the junk food her little heart desires to the point it started effecting her health and anytime Kylee wanted something weather it be toys or staying up late and I told her no she could run to grandma and even though grandma knows I said no she would say yes. Sometimes when Kylee would get in trouble for misbehaving grandma would argue with me along with Kylee trying to defend her. 

I bought Kylee an iPhone for her birthday a few years back and wanted a debit card to put on file so she could down load certain apps. I told her she can't use my debit card because she is a child and I don't want any surprise charges on my phone so she goes and asks Grandma and Grandma said yes. I explained to grandma why this was a bad idea but she did not want to listen. 

  Kylee asked grandma if she could get a 10$ monthly subscription to an app using her card, I said no because grandma is on a fixed income and can't afford to pay monthly subscriptions but grandma says yes. This leads to extra charges and grandma having to call the bank and cancel her card. I tell her not to let Kylee add her card to her phone again but she doesn't listen. 

    Grandma let's Kylee add her card to her phone again although I told them both she is not allowed to do this, this time it leads to Kylee signing back up for the 10$ subscription with Grandma's permission and using grandma's card to buy Roblox also with Grandma's permission. Grandma forgets she allowed Roblox (about 50$ worth throughout the month some as a Christmas present) and didn't calculate it in her budget then comes up short on money at the end of the month and cancels her bank card gets refunded the money but has to wait for a new card. Accept for this time I make Kylee Pay back half of the money.

  Well last night not even two weeks after grandma got her new card in the mail I find out she let Kylee put her card on her iPhone again and let Kylee sign up for a free trial on her phone as long as she cancels the membership before her card is charged. Nobody said anything to me about this and now 40$ has been charged to grandma's card from apple because Kylee thinks you cancel a subscription if you delete the app she has no idea what she was doing so after the trial is up grandma gets changed for the subscription. After Kylee leaves to school grandma comes up to me and says she doesn't know how we are going to do this if she should make Kylee Pay for the whole thing or only half.

I caught him saying sexual stuffs such as “69” to his online friends and “I want to f*ck your mum” as his discord status… 

Seeing those messages has got me worried and got me curious on what led him to say such things… he likes to play games such as minecraft and roblox. He’s homeschooled-online schooling, so his friends who likes to play games has a discord server that they use to socialize and use while they’re playing… he also watches a lot of YT videos of gamers. Thinking abt those two factors has led me to assume that he might have picked up some bad content from some gamers (I sometimes overhear them saying bad words or trolling words that are inappropriate) or some of his friends might have said it. But of course, I’m not totally sure

I just want to know how is the best way I can talk to him about this as I don’t just plainly want to say that its bad or shame him about it or say that he’s young enough to understand because he does and has already an idea to it.

My mom has work up here and has been staying with us on and off for a year. It's been just fine. I found out I'm pregnant again and I don't know if I'm just hormonal or if I need a new strategy around the both of them. 

The problem
 

I've had issues with my son on yt. He has caught bad kid videos on there and I limit that screen time to as little as possible. He has access to TV and his nintendo and toys as well. He uses the phone to play roblox. I'm fine with all that, but yt is a sore subject. For game help and certain yt creators it's fine but he drifts off onto the shorts and I'm scared he will he exposed to something inappropriate. So today after doing yt and games he went to play in his room and I told him no yt for tonight, all done. I go to check on him an hour later and he's on yt. Watching something weird. I tell him he was told no, start to go into him going behind my back when my mom comes in and starts a whole rant cutting me off about how there can be bad videos on there and it's not his fault if those come on and yadda yadda yadda. 

I feel really annoyed and shut down by her about my own kid. I tell him no phone tonight n tell him he will have limited time tomorrow because he disobeyed and leave the room. She's in there extra long probably cuddling him about big bag mom.

She comes out into the living room and I tell her without him hearing that I dont appreciate her going off topic when I'm talking to my son about disobeying.

She tells me that if I want him to obey I have to explain it to him why there are dangers. I tell her I already have many, many times before and right then wasn't about the dangers of yt it was about being told no and then doing it anyway. She then remarks that I must not know he's only 8. Oh it pissed me off. I don't say anything and just calm down and then after a few minutes I go into his room and I talk to him about some things are fun on yt, but he needs to watch that in the room with an adult. Screen time is fine but when his time is up on it it's up and to do that behind my back makes me disappointed.  He understands and we hug it out. End of topic.

I go back out in the living room and tell her sorry and tell her I explained to him n she still acts all mad.

AITA? I feel like I might be. But she's also done this before. Sometimes, not every time I scold my kid or correct him she jumps in and tries to change the subject and talk to him about something else. 

I feel like its really rude. He's my kid to parent. I don't spank him, I don't yell, we talk about what he did wrong, why and either clean it up together or if it's really bad a time out. It's rare because he's a really good kid and usually nothing beyond ""hey let's not do that"" is all it takes. Just sometimes something like a breaking of trust is something I want to talk more about. I feel like she acts like she has to jump in or explain to him why I'm scolding him and it's really unneeded. We always talk about it. Either right away or a minute to cool down then talk. 

Am I just being too dramatic about this? Have you dealt with this? I don't want to be rude to her, but it is my house and I have a very good kid because I do parent him well. His father does live here too but is always working or doing his own thing. He's taken on double shifts and does what he wants on his time off. So majority of the parenting is me. I'm mom and dad to our son. Which means nurture and the talking to if needed. To me It feels like my mom is trying to take over the nurturing side entirely and leave me no room to do that n I'm stuck with the discipline side. Making me the bad guy constantly. And cuddling him after I speak to him. 

I'm not the best at being both parents. That's true. But I feel like I should be able to talk to my own kid without her buffering everything I say to him. 

Idk. If I'm being dramatic just please let me know. I tried to be as neutral explaining this as possible but I'm clearly biased to my own side. So take that with what you will.",t5_2qhn3,0,0.5

Tldr since this got longer than expected. I think my son is acting up because I’ve had a baby, how can I help him? 

I have 2 kids my son is 8 and daughter is almost 5 months old. We’re on the waiting list to have my son assessed for autism so I do try to keep that in mind but his behaviour and attitude is becoming horrendous lately and I really don’t know what to do. He adores his baby sister and he wants to play/cuddle with her all the time but it’s too much. I can’t leave him alone in the same room as her anymore to even run to the toilet because he picks her up, I’ve explained to him so many times why he can’t do that and how dangerous it is but no matter what I say he’s convinced nothing bad will happen and it’ll be fine. He throws toys when he has a meltdown or swings them around when he’s playing usually close to the baby. When he does this I take away the toy until the next day but he’ll just pick up a different one and do the same. So then he has time out which is spent with him screaming and crying the entire time.

In the last 2 weeks he’s started waking her up, sometimes it’s an accident but it’s usually on purpose, literally every time she falls asleep or starts dozing off, i tell him why he can’t do that but he either completely ignores me and carries on or says sorry, stops for a little bit then starts up again like he’s forgot. He’s started bragging to other kids that he doesn’t listen to me (so he clearly knows what he’s doing is wrong), he argues about everything and anything possible, even when I agree with him about something he argues wtf? It’s so mentally draining.

I try to stay as calm as possible and talk it through with him but he ignores me or shouts at me that he knows but then still continues. I know it must be hard for him having a new baby in the house when it was just me and him for so long and it’s even harder since I’m ebf, so when baby is eating or sleeping I help him with his homework, we’ll play a board game or Roblox together (he’s not allowed to play online games unsupervised and it’s easier for me to know what’s going on if I’m in the game with him, I can see the chats). We do movies and snuggles, we’re reading the Harry Potter books together. I don’t know what else I could be doing to spend quality time with him so he doesn’t feel left out and I don’t know how to combat the behaviour and attitude. 

He goes to his dads most weekends and his dad tried to talk to him about this but had just as much luck as me. He has another sister (5) at dads and I recently found out that he’s hit and spat at her. This is beyond unacceptable and disgusting and I told son that when I heard about it. I honestly didn’t think he would ever do something like that. He’s always been so kind and sweet, I don’t recognise who he’s becoming. Any advice is more than welcome.",t5_2qhn3,5,1.0

We were watching a show together and he turned to me and said, ""Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about."" So I turned the TV off and gave him my full attention because it sounded different than just a ""I did this cool thing at school/I played Roblox and../So and so said..."" etc. 

He said, ""I'm pretty sure I don't like girls, and I only like boys.""

I almost exploded with pride. He and I are very close, and it is something I have suspected about him for a very long time... I can't really say why, it is just a mothers intuition. But I've never told him as such. I've only taught him since he was old enough to understand, that everyone is free to love who ever they want to love. That families can look different than ours (a peaceful split with his dad when he was 3.5) ...some have two moms, some have two dads, some dads sadly passed away, some only have their mom to live with. 

What I was proud of was the fact that not only he felt comfortable being open enough to have that conversation with his parents (he told me he also had talked to his dad about it as well), but that he had the emotional intelligence to understand what he's feeling and to put it into words. 

I just smiled and thanked him for sharing that with me and that I'm proud of him for doing so. I did go on to say that he doesn't have to figure any of this stuff out right now, but am glad he is aware of how he's feeling at this point in time. I said, ""maybe you won't feel the same about it in a few years, and maybe you will feel like this and more! But no matter what, I'm just so proud that you're my kid and you can like who ever you want to like."" Then thanked him again for sharing that with me. He basically said, ""cool"", and we started watching our baking series again. 

I'm really hoping I handled it well. I started to doubt myself a little bit afterwards because I said the thing about how he may not feel like this later.

for some context, i live in Asia, people are generally nice, but there are some perks that are just off.

my 9Year old Daughter doesn;t even understand what ""to be considerate"" means.

as example her mother sleeps in the same room as her, she playing Roblox and voice chatting with some neighbor friends .. but she does it in a manner which makes impossible for her mother to sleep.

she isn't a bad girl or whatever, its just somethings people around here don't really do.  
like another example (adult) when i drive the car with more people in it, i choose the parking to ensure everyone gets out easy and maybe place the car in a direction where disavantaged passengers will have it more easy, this is somethings you will never see happening around here.

again its not bad people, just different culture. but i for once find the fact that people not considered at all in a country where the nicety of people is one of the things that makes them stand out for the rest of the world quite bad.

so the question here is, how do i teach my daughter to be considerate, without forcing it on her, and without having any support from the sourrounding society?",t5_2qhn3,2,1.0

My 9 year has always been a fairly easy child. Every step on my journey of being her mom has been easy. She’s always very respectful and well behaved, highest praises from every teacher she’s had, and very emotionally mature for her age. After I separated from my husband almost a year ago, I was convinced by family members to get her a phone for my safety as my husband had gotten physical with me before he moved out. My family was worried that if he ever showed up to try to hurt me no one would be around to help.

After getting her phone I started seeing little red flags here and there; she was always on FaceTime with her little group of friends and from what I was hearing they seemed like a bunch of little drama llamas. But I remember being her age and although I didn’t love it, I recognized that it was normal. I’ve never had any reason to not trust her. I had parental controls on her phone and since she is underage it was my Apple ID that was used on her phone, where my debit card is linked. She still needed me to enter my password to download apps and such so I always knew what she was up to. 

I’m a single mom to my two girls. We’re a one income household and I don’t get financial support from my STBX. I make $22/hr and it’s enough to pay the bills and necessities but there’s very little left for unnecessary expenses. I’m expecting a promotion with a much higher salary soon and I had a nice little cushion in my bank account from my Christmas bonus. For the first time in months I had more than a single digit number in my account on payday week. Things were looking hopeful. 

My brother sent $100 through Zelle for my daughter to buy Robux for Christmas and with my permission and help she’s been buying here and there. I was at work one day and she wanted to buy some and asked for my password so my mom could help her with it. As I said, great kid and no reason to not trust her. I reminded her how much money she had spent and how she had left to spend from her Christmas money.

Yesterday I went to pay my internet bill as it was shut off when I got home work. My card declined and I checked my bank account to see that I only had $45. I reviewed my transactions thinking that it was me who overspent. I saw $400 in charges for Robux over a week. I cried. 

She understands how electronic payments work. She knows she was spending from my bank account and she says she just got carried away. 

I took away her phone, permanently, and explained that in a few years we’ll try again because she shown over the last few months that she’s not ready for it and spending all my money was the final straw. I looked through her phone history to see if I could piece anything together in the situation and saw that she reset my Apple ID password and was Googling how to add Robux to a group fund. Apparently she was providing Robux the group she created with her friends. 

After seeing how calculated she was in this, I also canceled her 10th birthday celebration next month. I planned on taking her a few friends out to dinner and some activities. 

From everything I understand about discipline and consequences, I feel like the situation should be done now and I should let it go because she’s already received her consequences but it doesn’t feel done. I’m so angry and hurt. And I’m angry at myself too. I’m having such a hard time because I know that it’s not healthy to give the silent treatment or anything like that but I’m having such a hard time because I don’t really want to talk to her. 

How can I handle this in a healthy way?",t5_2qhn3,9,0.74

Her teacher said she's the best reader for her age she's literally ever known, by a long way. She's reading (silently to herself) for pleasure and can handle all the words thrown at her in general. She loves doing her maths for pleasure too and will write genuine stories (usually about princesses dying but hey...) for pleasure again. We'll just get presented with a 4 page book out of the blue, written with lovely handwriting etc.

Same time though, she LOVES TV, and found that her favourite thing is typically whatever comes up next on the YT Kids app on TV. This tends to be 12yr olds (and mid 30s women acting as if they're 12 yr olds) playing Minecraft and Roblox. She also likes a lady who paints old squishy toys, and also lots of colouring / drawing channels. Especially with the drawing she'll get pens and paper for herself and draw along, with lovely results. 

She used to love Ryan's World, but that and a few other ""Photogenic kids being exploited by their parents in a bizarrely empty and white house"" channels did quietly go on the block list.

She's just about to go to school as I type this. On school mornings she'll always have to eat, wash, dress before any TV at all, and when she does she always asks alexa to set a timer to go off after however she's told she can have... Weekends can be a bit more of a free-for-all though, as it's a good way for her to relax after a busy week of after school clubs etc.

So obviously... do you fellow parents think this is OK? There are (IMHO) good channels she likes, and other ones I feel are clearly awful. But then I'm some ancient dad who's just out of touch...? It feels like a shame she's watching poorly made, badly scripted clips rather than quality production values yet... eh... she likes it, and is clearly a bright shiny button of a kid.",t5_2qhn3,0,0.5

AS girl aged nearly 12 and a boy of 10 years old. They both like playing computer games. Especially the boy who would prefer to do nothing else all day.

We've limited their screen time to an acceptable amount, but I'm kind of worried about the kind of games he likes to play. The games he's been spending most of his time with in the last few weeks have been what I'd call lootbox simulators.

Pet simulator on Roblox is the most recent one. I've watched him play some and the core gameplay loop is, click on a box so your pets will destroy/open it. Coins come out and you can used the coins to buy eggs from which you get better pets, rolled on a random loot table. And then you go on to the next area where the boxes require more effort (AKA Better pets) to be opened and the cycle repeats.

I've got the feeling/suspicion that this game is doing nothing else but feed a basic dopamine loop not unlike a Skinner box and I'm worried that this is unhealthy for him.

I'm aware that games have gotten easier over time. When computers made it in to my life when I was a tween games were pretty brutal by today's standards, but this 'game' doesn't seem to offer any kind of challenge, just the gambling aspect of getting a superior, more rare pet from the eggs that you buy with the ingame currency\*.

His sister plays the game as well sometimes, but most of the time when she plays Roblox she spends her time roleplaying/playing pretend. Though because she does play, it's turning the game in to a contest for her younger brother, making him want to play even more.

Should I do something to stop him playing these kinds of games so much? And if so, what would be a good way?

&#x200B;

\*: You can use premium currency to buy better eggs, but that's something we don't allow and our kids know how freemium games use this mechanic to lure people in to constantly spending money.

**Edit:** I forgot to mention, in all his other media habits, TV, youtube, books he really favors the short and to the point stuff like grizzly and the lemmings (which is basically a modern wiley e coyote cartoon), let's play youtubers who hype up their reactions and books like 13-storey treehouse.

This strategy has proven to be great thus far because she always comes to us to ask questions, work through a hurtful or rude situation with friends, ask what certain things mean. Having the chance to have a conversation and teach her etiquette and social coping skills for the tech part of her life feels important in helping her navigate it at a later age, when stakes are higher and parents are not as involved.

This being said, she is one of a very few 5th graders who doesn’t have a phone. Most had them in 3rd and 4th grade. I’m not sure why this feels like a big next step but it does.

We live in Florida and the school was cancelled because the hurricane Ian was coming. My wife was at work and I was staying home with our kids 3(f) and 7(m). I put my daughter down for her nap and my son was playing Roblox on his phone ( I know I know). 
I started getting the place ready for the hurricane by ""nailing"" down anything that can fly and getting all of the garbage together to dispose of it. 
Now, we live in an apartment community and the garbage disposal is a 2 minute walk from our building. It's not a rare occasion that you would see cars with garbage bags on their hood driving by because the disposal is next to the entrance/exit of the community.
When I got all of the garbage/boxes together I asked my son if he wants to walk with me or to stay home. He chose to stay in. Not the the first time, although, up to about 6 months ago he was very apprehensive of staying home alone and would always chose the tagging along option.
So off I went and was gone for about 7 to 8 minutes. On a way back I get a phone call from him. His phone is fully functional and he has his own number.  He uses it to video chat with grandparents in NY or call mom at work (I work from home) and use mobile internet during trips. Before I could answer the phone call dropped. I called him back but the line was busy. 
I knew something was up so I ran home. It took me about 30 seconds after his call to get there.  When I made it, he was in tears and on a phone with someone, who, I was pretty sure, was my wife. 
He saw me walking in, said to whoever it was  that everything is fine now, bye and hung up. 
I asked him what happened and he said he thought I was missing. He said he needs to tell me something. I said sure. He said I thought it was an emergency and called 911. Sure enough his phone started ringing and it was a local police department calling back to make sure we are fine. The lady said she received a phone call from a child stating that his father was missing. I assured her that everything is fine indeed and I was only gone for 8 minutes taking a garbage out prior to hurricane hitting the area.
She said thank you for confirming and that was the end of it. 
But.. My son was in so much stress. He thought the police will come and take him away from us and place him with foster parents (his best friend's parents are going through a really bad divorce, that's where he gets his info from). I did my best to convince him it is not going to happen unless he will continue calling the police every time I'm gone for less than 10 minutes. Obviously, I'm not going to leave him home alone again, even if he begs me to. 
We had a long conversation about what real emergencies are and when it's a good call to get the police involved. 
He was shaken for about 40 minutes or so after it happened and then went to his usual self. He brought it up again when my wife came home and we went through what the emergency situations are again. 
He truly believed it was an emergency and I was lost or something, that is why he made a call.

I blame Roblox:)). He might have lost the track of time playing his rainbow friends game.

For context - we never left our kids home alone. Not a single time. Cleaning outside or walking a dog, if they don't want to join but can still see us,  is the only time when they are inside by ""themselves"". 

Anyway, I would love if you could share similar incidents and how you handled them. 


Tldr: My kid called the police while I was taking the garbage out and he thought I was gone missing. It all happened within 8 minutes span.

Ps. I see that some of you have different opinion whether or not my son should have a fully functional phone. I want to make it clear that I see no harm in him using his phone and play some games on it. He gets about an hour of game time per day. He may still use his phone for other tasks, like reading, math, drawing etc.
All of it is easily controlled through parents app and phone settings.

We relented this October and got him the headset/mic for his birthday for his (my) Xbox.  I figured it would be a good way for him to be social with other kids.  I only allow him to play age-appropriate games, and I made him sign a written contract like a lunatic the day he got these.

He has respected the rules and not broken the contract.  But he doesn't STFU!!!  He's talking to kids non-stop in the hour he is allowed to play.  He lost two friends today because they were probably so freaking annoyed from him talking at them for an hour straight.

She has always slept next to me and my bf’s bed since she was born. Her crib then now bed has always been next to us just b/c of living arrangements in his parents house. They refurbished the basement where is now an open area. With the stairs split in the middle. We took one side and made the other area for her, like her own little bedroom where she has her clothes, kitchen set and other toys. She didn’t like the idea of sleeping away from us but I’d figure now is the time for her to learn to sleep on our own, without us right next to her. The problem now is, around I’d say 4 or 5 months ago we have started noticing every single sound scares her. And I mean every single sound. He doesn’t like the dark, needs to see every thing and needs to know what every single noise is. I think it’s due to my bf’s mom no regulating what she watching on her phone (my daughter does have her own iPad, but goes for her phone more because she knows she can do whatever she wants on it. She plays Roblox and watches YouTube clips of whatever is on it. We have tried to tell his mom, she needs to regulate what she’s doing on her phone but she doesn’t quite care. She is who watches her while both of us work during the day. ) i think Roblox has basically made her scared of noises because of all the scary games there are on it. I refuse to have her sleep on our bed because she needs to learn to sleep in her own bed. There has been nights where I have just given in because we’ve just been so exhausted. There was a night where we both called out of work because we got 0 sleep. I honestly don’t know what to do or how to approach this or how to fix it. I’ve recently started giving her kids melatonin to ease her into sleep but she still manages to wake up and not go back to bed easily. So any advice or experience is kindly appreciated for this sleep deprived (in the 3rd trimester) mom",t5_2qhn3,1,1.0

My daughter is 11 and we moved to Australia about 5 years ago. In that time we lived in 3 states for work related reasons and I think that took a toll on my daughter’s social life. New language, different culture, missing family and then making friends with difficulty only to leave them during the next move. 
We have finally settled in a city about 2 hours from the state capital, bought our own place. She likes her school and is good friends with D. D has been a lot of support these 2 years with play dates and lots of activities together outside the school. D is also Indian and that might have been a factor contributing to their bonding as well. 


D called her just now from India to wish her happy new year and told her that her parents have decided to move to the state capital for better educational opportunities. We were both surprised.

It’s so hard to make new friends as an adult in a new different country, I can’t watch her go through that again. I miss my family, my friends and the festival season has brought the feelings of isolation and loneliness back so strongly. How do me and my daughter navigate this?

Not in a depressed way, just matter-of-fact in response to us asking if he wanted to invite friends for his birthday.

He's on the autism spectrum but is very bright and enjoys things that a neurotypical ten-year-old does: Minecraft/Roblox, Mario (and video games generally), minions, funny cat videos, explosions and action movies and fart jokes, etc. He's a possibly a little more non-sequitur about his interests than maybe the average kid would be,  but he's not fixated and he can go with the flow.

His biggest obvious marker is a speech impediment -- he pretty obviously doesn't say his Rs correctly, and it's severe enough that even I sometimes need him to repeat himself or enunciate more clearly, but he speaks fluently and uses age-appropriate vocabulary, etc. I'm sure this is an obstacle for socialization, but he's in speech therapy and is working on it -- he's made a lot of improvements, and the R thing is the big one that he's working on now.

He'll independently talk to other kids and even join in with them if they're playing a game, but a lot of times he's just doing his own thing -- if we take him to the park he'll sometimes play tag with other kids, but other times he'll just climb on the net or swing on the zipline by himself, or whatever. When he does interact with other kids he's friendly and polite and helpful, good about taking turns, etc, so I know it's not that he's hard to get along with.

But I don't know how to help him make friends. We live in a neighborhood where most of the kids are much older or younger. We also have be a 7-year-old daughter, and we set up play dates for her with our friends' kids (and we include our son in those, too, but sometimes he isn't interested in playing with 7-year-old girls), but nobody we know has a son around his age. There's a neighbor girl who is in his class at school and we spend time with their family (they also have a 6-year-old son) and our kids get along (e.g., they're excited to get together and play video games, or play games, or go to the park together), but at 10 boys and girls typically don't want to be close friends, even if they get along well (plus, I can tell that the neighbor girl likes our son well enough but doesn't see him as a close friend).

He's not very athletic, although we put him in stuff like swimming lessons and karate and golf camp and he enjoys those well enough, and gets along with the other kids but there's usually an age gap. Also, he has a hard time with repeated defeat and frustration and is a bit more timid than other kids when it comes to physical risk, and he hasn't really expressed interest even when asked, so we haven't signed him up for team sports. We put him in other group activities like robot camp and French class, and he has fun in those, but they usually but very long and usually have a wider age range, too.

We've spoken to his teacher and school counselor, and his teacher says he's friendly and happy in class and gets along with the other kids, but at recess and such tend to spend time by himself. The counselor added a goal to his IEP to improve social relationships, but I'm unclear how that's happening and he's obviously still mostly a loner.

My heart breaks for him. He's such a great kid, but between the autism and the pandemic lockdowns he hasn't learned to make friends, and there haven't been any organic opportunities among our friends group or in the neighborhood, so most of his socialization is at school. He's so smart and capable and has made so much progress in so many areas of his life, but I worry for his future if he's unable to find a friend group.",t5_2qhn3,39,0.95

So I have a 6 year old in 1st grade. Normal upbringing and family life. No major trauma or abuse or anything that I'm aware of. Lately, whenever she is disciplined for any type of wrongdoing her response has been turning incredibly...dark. No matter how calmly I try to explain what she did wrong and why it was wrong (and punishment is typically a 6 minute time-out) she immediately turns to comments such as ""I'm so stupid"" and ""I can't do anything right"" and it has recently and abruptly changed to ""I'm going to run away"" and the other day she straight up sat down and said ""I'm going to kill myself"" and double-downed on this later.       
We were shocked and heartbroken. I've had a number of talks with her since, trying to ask her more about what she's feeling and why and make sure she understands the gravity of her thoughts while doing my best to be gentle and not press too hard but also let her know that she can talk to us but she doesn't have to right away if she doesn't want to. She essentially says that she would rather be dead so that she doesn't have to deal with her bad feelings/discipline. I've of course reiterated the permanence of death and that she can always talk to parents/teachers/friends or whomever she feels comfortable with and we can think of ways to deal with these feelings etc.

Edit: People asking for more to the story: My friend just recently passed away. I was going through grief and still managed to help do laundry all day after I finished work. My wife told me not to work the next day (I didn't anyway) then said she wanted to watch the Harry Potter series all day as a family. I told her I was waiting weeks to watch stranger things and it came out. She said we could go to the theaters and I said I didn't want to see minions 2. I suggested other things, but she didn't want to see anything else, just minions 2. After they got tickets, my friend called and asked if I could go to my friend who passed away's burial. I said yes and was glad I didn't get tickets for the movie. I told my daughter about who died and my wife tried to interject and I ignored her and told my daughter and told her where I was going instead of the movie. Then my wife went out the movies with her. After the movie was done, I tried calling because it was my friend's child's birthday and even though we went to a burial we were still trying to celebrate the birthday and my friend wanted my wife and daughter to come by. She never answered the phone or responded to my texts. The next day she just randomly came home. The mutual friend we have was a woman, so this wasn't about cheating, she was angry I didn't make the day a family day. But today she did the same thing, took our daughter out and wasn't answering my calls or texts. They are about to take a trip out of country, and I was supposed to go, but I feel like I'm just being used and she just wants me there just to show she has a husband (edit: as in to keep up appearances), not because she actually wants me there, and considering what she did with this whole taking daughter out and not telling me where was my final decision on if I was going with them.

Hopefully that extra part clears up the why she did it, but regardless of why, I don't think it's right. I told her she can go wherever she wants and doesn't have to tell me, but if she takes our child, I need to know where our child is to put my mind at ease and in case anything happens I can know where they were.",t5_2qhn3,306,0.95

I've tried to teach him using scratch but I think that again it was a bit boring and we stopped working through the book.  

I think joining a club or a camp would be more fun for my son and they will have an educational program to follow.  

I found some services with online classes but would like to get some suggestions from personal experience for sites that offer live classes for kids or maybe online clubs that my son can join.  It could be anything (beginner) from Minecraft, programming or electronics projects, 3D printing.

I have an 11 year old son with ADHD. It's been difficult to say the least. Right now I don't want to have a drink, or get high and forget about all my problems. I just want to do what I have to to make sure my son thrives in this world. But it's so hard. And my best just isn't good enough. I stress constantly about the quality of life he will grow into. 

Nothing motivates him. Not rewards or punishment. I don't believe in hitting kids. But my patience is constantly being put to the test. 

He has a issue with keeping his room clean and I told him he had to straighten up or he would get bugs. And he had to put all his dishes away in the kitchen. We went back and forth about it because he wanted me to do it for him and said I had no reason not to. I turned off his console and he got really upset and swatted a bowl to the ground and was yelling at me. He got in trouble and I sent him to bed early. Most recently we have had to deal with him losing control of his emotions. In school he got into a tussle with another student because the other student broke something of his. (From what he described it was a toy or something) but i don't think it was the whole story because other boys were involved and he didn't tell me how. 

That same day while he was at school I looked at his YouTube account and saw he was on his phone at all hours, Sometimes 3 and 4 am, and last week he started making comments cursing at people saying things like ""That S is Fing gay"" and things of that nature. He also has mentioned Andrew Tate. Which was really concerning for me. I have told him to stay away from that content and why it's wrong. 

I took away his phone (except during school hours since he doesn't use it there) and allowed him to at least call his friend on the weekend. I also put some more secure parental locks and restrictions on his phone. That was last week. And now today, I come into his room and someone starts yelling over and over again, horrible words, every bad word you can think of. The N word (hard ER) Sh*t, fu*k, b*tch. Just saying them over and over again. Apparently it's someone his friend from school knows. And when I asked him why didn't he just leave the room? He said it's none of his business, ""why do I care, I'm not his dad"". I asked if this happens all the time and he said yes. I sat him down and I explained to him why I was upset and it was the last straw and I was going to have to really make some changes. 

So far I have been trying gentle parenting. His punishments so far have been doing things like writing in a journal (which he hates doing because it's boring) and spending more time with his family. Doing his own laundry. When he is done with his chores, I say he can still play on his PlayStation but I limit it to 2 hours on weekdays. 

Video games is the one thing he really likes to do. I'm currently trying to find him some activities like tournaments he can train and participate in and maybe videogame testing for cash. He also started a YouTube page, I help him with edits and even make some of my own for his page, and I'm researching some streaming equipment to gift him for Christmas (but after the incident I said he had to cool it for a while on YouTube) and while I don't agree or like the constant focus on video games, I don't want to squander his passions and I do what I can to encourage him. And I thought it wasn't hurting him. But now I'm not so sure. 

So I told him that I was at the end of my rope and this is my last resort and after I told him no phone and no PS5 until his He started yelling and screaming, he was clearly having a panic attack. I tried to calm myself down, calm him down, offered him cold water and breathing exercises, he was really defiant he just lost control. I tried to call his dad but he got even more upset. He was crying and yelling and screaming and hitting the chair (which I told him not to do) saying ""why me?"" ""I should of done so and so"" crying and saying he just wanted to play Roblox with one of his other friends (they have been online friends for some years, I'm actually planning a trip so they can finally meet, my son thinks of him as his brother) I even told him he can have one more night but tomorrow thing are going to change. He couldn't accept that. He kept crying, hyperventilating, begging me not to take his phone or his PS. 

I understand his has ADHD (he does take medication, but I'm going to call his dr and see if we can explore getting it readjusted, I'm thinking with him going through puberty and hormones it might not be enough anymore. He just can't focus) I know all that comes with it includes a low frustration tolerance, difficultly with hygiene (I'm not sure he probably bathes himself. Sometimes he just sits in the shower) and lack of motivation (I'm not sure if it's the right way to say that but i have read it's hard for people with ADHD to focus on goals and achieve them) but it's not really an option to just give up on teaching him. While I do have help I struggle to find a stable income. Getting him involved in activities like kids football or karate cost money that I can't really afford to spend right now. (I'm saving for trade school) and I don't really know how else to keep him occupied at home without him complaining about being bored to tears. 
I know it will all come with time but I'm still scared for the future. What if he doesn't get it? What if he hurts someone? What if he loses his temper at the wrong time with the wrong person and ends up dead or in jail? And as a black young adult everyone knows the statistics there. 

When I tell you I want to cry right now but I still feel so numb. I don't know what else to really do. While forcing him to do anything seems wrong I know that I can't do nothing. I will say I never wanted to be a parent and this is why. Raising humans is not easy at all. Raising disabled black boys is even harder. One hand people say ""his mama should of whooped his ass"" and the other says ""boys need love and consideration"" and you can't really do both. 

I believe I also have ADHD and I don't know how I would have wanted to be parented in this type of situation. I don't want him to hate me but I'm slowly accepting that no matter what I do or how I do it I'm going to be the villain. I am really dreading the teenaged years. I don't want to break his spirit but his spirit is very much an jerk at this point. There is more to this story but I'm getting tired of feeling like I'm bad mouthing my kid. He fell asleep which is expected and I guess I'm just venting right now.",t5_2qhn3,2,1.0

So we seem to have inadvertently adopted my kid's ""girlfriend"".  She came over this weekend and never really left: they played Roblox and video games, sometimes they watched the toddler while I did the laundry or the dishes. This weekend was my toddler's birthday so we invited her to come to the zoo with us (my kid has always been allowed to bring a friend, as he's well beyond the ""let's put the rocks down and look at the monkey"" phase) and somehow that morphed into a sleepover and then she fell asleep on our couch again for the third time in two days and by the time I sent her home she'd spent 30 hours with us. Even our dog has stopped growling at her, and if you know our dog, you know that's a big thing.

And I kinda had the impression that she still did not want to go home.  I wouldn't have a problem with letting her stay longer if we'd arranged it with her parents, but our agreement was for this one night.  But I also suspect that we're dealing with a situation that's in that gray zone between ""different parents, parenting differently"" and some level of neglect.  I'm not the motherly type.

I feel like the time I used playing outside was a vital part of my upbringing.

Number 2 is the reason I'm writing here looking at active games and other active digital experiences. I would love it if any of you guys have some active gaming alternatives that I don't know of. Looking for motivator to replace just some of the ""Fortnite time"".

This is my current list sorted by my requirement (having a small living room):

Wii: The best indoor way to give him an alternative to Fortnight and Roblox

Switch: for one Fortnight and Minecraft are kings on the switch and I did buy Ring Fit Adventures but the game felt more like a chore and fell out of favor fast. Also, have to Switch Sports and it is a mixed bag dependent on who is playing and how much energy me and Daniel have.

Bought a lot of promising products:

Playfinity ball: Was cool in the start and if your kid loves throwing and catching a ball you might have a better result, but Daniel got bored after a couple of weeks.

WRDLS ball: This was the biggest letdown loved the concept but the delivery was really bad. The games were both buggy, unfinished, and not fun

UDU Console: This is the latest project I backed. The game's graphics look a bit shit in my opinion, but the concept seems interesting at least. If it delivers it also seems like a cool piece of hardware.

Also looked at other pokemon go like games (Daniel loves RPG like games):

The Witcher: Monster Slayer: was a bit realistic in the graphics and couldn't and just worse than pokemon go

Orna: Orna is a great time sink for anyone who likes RPG, but it is a slow and stats-heavy RPG. We played it together for a couple of months and will still pick it up at times

VR: I would love to have VR but it is a bit too expensive and I don't have the space for it

They have 1 boy (6) and I have 3 boys (3, 7, 12). 
My 12 and my 7 year old like horror games. Nothing crazy - think Poppy Playtime and Five Nights at Freddy’s. 
Their son is autistic - doesn’t like scary things and has nightmares. 
My kids try hard to be considerate of this by not allowing him to watch and my 7 year old even keeps his scarier plush toys at his fathers home instead of mine. Sometimes their son try to get my 7 year old to let him watch and he’s pretty adamant about not letting him see or says why don’t we play something less scary on Roblox. 
My kids don’t have nightmares and they know that these things aren’t real and it’s just for fun. My oldest once wanted to watch the Conjuring and got scared and said nope this is freaking me out so we turned it off. I don’t make them watch/play scary things and there is plenty off limits and if I felt these games were messing with them I’d for sure ban them as well.

It’s pretty hurtful even though I feel like I understand my children’s feeling and if it was affecting them negatively I’d act accordingly. And we do everything we can to accommodate the comfort of their child who feels things differently and I totally get that. 
She’s even made digs while I was at her home saying what kind of awful people let their kids play this stuff, knowing damn well I do. 
The thing I don’t get is she allows him to play stuff like Among Us, which you literally kill people and and try to lie your way out of getting caught, which seems just as bad to me. There is actual depiction of being shot, eaten, or chopped in half too. And Poppy Playtime (the one she really seems to hate) is more about chasing/jump scares, more tension based same with FNAF but somehow they are worse. No blood or gore. 
Anyways, I’m down for brutal opinions. Do you guys think it’s terrible to let my kids play or watch other kids play these? Should I have a discussion about this with her to try to ease her mind? Or just continue to do my best and keep to my own like I’ve been doing? I guess it’s just rough having mean words hurled at you but wanting to keep the peace. And to be clear I respect her decision as a parent to not allow her son to play these, she knows him better than I do and I will always do everything in my power to respect her choices as a parent.

I want to be white.”,xastrobabe,2022-04-06,1649270508.0,"I overheard my 8 year old niece saying this as she’s playing Roblox (?) explaining why she chose the skin tone, saying “This is why I only pick white skin for my characters because it is the prettiest skin tone.”

I didn’t respond strongly, thinking that she might be factual (Maybe she doesn’t see her comments the same way I do) so I simply asked “In game or you?” And she said “Me. Look at my skin, I am black.”

I do not know how to handle this subject. (I am light skinned and she’s darker skinned)

It seems to me that ROBLOX is just a huge pool of grown children with nothing better to do and potential predators. 

Is there any way to make sure my son is safe while playing?

I don’t currently let him play ROBLOX but he does play Minecraft(no friends) and his time is limited. I don’t understand ROBLOX and what makes it so alluring to kids. 

Help a parent out.

The kids (9m and 7f) get themselves up and can help themselves to cereal/make toast until Mum gets up or I get in from nightshift. Boychild has taken to getting up really early (6am ish) and going down to play on FIFA on the PlayStation. 

After repeatedly being told that TV is ok, but gaming isn't we concluded the trust based system wasn't working and activated screen time limits and active hours restrictions on the PlayStation. 

The next morning he was still up early and playing Roblox on the PC. Delivered lecture about the fact that the PlayStation was locked should have meant that the PC was out of bounds too and restricted screen time and active hours on the PC too. 

Just realised that he's been playing FIFA for longer than his daily screen time limit, and questioned him. It turned out the little sod had used his allotted time and then logged into his sister's profile to carry on playing. 

SMH I don't know if I should be annoyed with him or impressed. What I do know is that the Apple hasn't fallen far from the tree here, and that this is obviously Karma because I was exactly the same when I was a kid.",t5_2qhn3,0,0.5

What to do?,XtremeWRATH360,2022-08-18,1660828041.0,"So my son loves playing army men and loves pretending hes shooting and kniving bad guys. Well some times he does get a little carried away. Well my wife and mother in law went on a trip away for several days and i guess he was getting more carried away than usual and now the MIL thinks hes going to grow up to shoot up schools and wants everything tied to guns taken away. He has nerf gus, army men, gi joe figures and  plays some army games on roblox. All that is to be taken away and my wife is siding with the MIL. My concern is this isn't addressing the problem and just taking everything away isnt going to help him understand what is happening. He has ADHD and slight autism so im concerned taking everything away will do more harm than good because he doesnt understand fully and cant comprehend why hes having everything he enjoys being taken away. Im looking for some advise and guidance is my way of thinking wrong or should we be taking evertything away?",t5_2qhn3,0,0.5
