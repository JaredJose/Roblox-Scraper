My son is 5 and became really interested in Minecraft and Roblox after he downloaded it a few months ago while at his grandmothers house. I’ve learned to play both of the apps with him to understand it better & see the positives. They’re fun games, I admit. My issue is every time he has to put the tablet away, he has a meltdown. Every time. The duration of these meltdowns vary but it’s stressful for us both.  Tonight I thought about just getting rid of the tablet until weekends to avoid this but I think you all may have more productive advice. How should I approach these meltdowns and tablet time? 

Things I’ve tried: 
1. Giving him 1 hour per day which he can earn more time or lose time based on behavior and activities (this is new but I’m iffy on this method) 
2. Setting a timer so he can see how much he has and giving frequent updates + Having a transition activity (which he rejects) 
3. Letting him just play all day, no limits (this did not work at all obviously) 

He is starting school next month which I hope will help naturally but for now he is home all day while I work. Any advice, tips, things I’m clearly doing wrong? Can’t put every detail in this post so ask if you need clarification on anything.",t5_2qhn3,9,0.86

&#x200B;

Got a message from her teacher today; LO just turned 5 in January. Teacher said LO was stirring her yogurt but not eating it (not terribly surprising to me) but we do usually stir up the yogurt before eating it. Teacher assistant asked LO if she was done and LO smarted off to her. 

&#x200B;

Teacher also mentioned she hasn't been playing/speaking nicely with her friends lately. 

&#x200B;

LO has been suffering from upper respiratory stuff since forever, we had her on a medication that was supposed to help deal with the symptoms but there was some recent research out that said some kids may suffer from side effects - depressed mood, etc, so we took her off of it. We hadn't noticed TOO much but she has been defiant / rude to her grandmother, who is her usual caretaker during the week when we're working. 

&#x200B;

Her little brother recently turned 1.5, and has been a handful, so he's getting a lot of extra attention of course, because of the fact that he's a toddler. I'm sure that's playing into it. 

&#x200B;

To be 100% truthful, she gets too much screen time. YouTube - usually gaming channels and family vlogs, I haven't seen much of what she's watching that is directly objectionable - and her tablet/Roblox on the laptop.

&#x200B;

After discussing with her mom what we should do, we've decided that less screen time and some time devoted exclusively for her each day should help. Personally, I'm fine with 100% cutting her off from YouTube, and overall restricting her (and our, to be fair,) screen time down to a more reasonable level. It's hard with her little brother, but they're worth the effort. 

&#x200B;

Do you have any other suggestions to help out? Experiences?  Our overall plan is, as stated:

More dedicated one on one time for her

Less screen time overall

Any other suggestions? Thank you!",t5_2qhn3,17,0.87

She is getting better about it, but it used to be really bad. She would sneak my daughter (Kylee 12) candy and treats and stuff her full of all of the junk food her little heart desires to the point it started effecting her health and anytime Kylee wanted something weather it be toys or staying up late and I told her no she could run to grandma and even though grandma knows I said no she would say yes. Sometimes when Kylee would get in trouble for misbehaving grandma would argue with me along with Kylee trying to defend her. 

I bought Kylee an iPhone for her birthday a few years back and wanted a debit card to put on file so she could down load certain apps. I told her she can't use my debit card because she is a child and I don't want any surprise charges on my phone so she goes and asks Grandma and Grandma said yes. I explained to grandma why this was a bad idea but she did not want to listen. 

  Kylee asked grandma if she could get a 10$ monthly subscription to an app using her card, I said no because grandma is on a fixed income and can't afford to pay monthly subscriptions but grandma says yes. This leads to extra charges and grandma having to call the bank and cancel her card. I tell her not to let Kylee add her card to her phone again but she doesn't listen. 

    Grandma let's Kylee add her card to her phone again although I told them both she is not allowed to do this, this time it leads to Kylee signing back up for the 10$ subscription with Grandma's permission and using grandma's card to buy Roblox also with Grandma's permission. Grandma forgets she allowed Roblox (about 50$ worth throughout the month some as a Christmas present) and didn't calculate it in her budget then comes up short on money at the end of the month and cancels her bank card gets refunded the money but has to wait for a new card. Accept for this time I make Kylee Pay back half of the money.

  Well last night not even two weeks after grandma got her new card in the mail I find out she let Kylee put her card on her iPhone again and let Kylee sign up for a free trial on her phone as long as she cancels the membership before her card is charged. Nobody said anything to me about this and now 40$ has been charged to grandma's card from apple because Kylee thinks you cancel a subscription if you delete the app she has no idea what she was doing so after the trial is up grandma gets changed for the subscription. After Kylee leaves to school grandma comes up to me and says she doesn't know how we are going to do this if she should make Kylee Pay for the whole thing or only half.

I caught him saying sexual stuffs such as “69” to his online friends and “I want to f*ck your mum” as his discord status… 

Seeing those messages has got me worried and got me curious on what led him to say such things… he likes to play games such as minecraft and roblox. He’s homeschooled-online schooling, so his friends who likes to play games has a discord server that they use to socialize and use while they’re playing… he also watches a lot of YT videos of gamers. Thinking abt those two factors has led me to assume that he might have picked up some bad content from some gamers (I sometimes overhear them saying bad words or trolling words that are inappropriate) or some of his friends might have said it. But of course, I’m not totally sure

I just want to know how is the best way I can talk to him about this as I don’t just plainly want to say that its bad or shame him about it or say that he’s young enough to understand because he does and has already an idea to it.

My mom has work up here and has been staying with us on and off for a year. It's been just fine. I found out I'm pregnant again and I don't know if I'm just hormonal or if I need a new strategy around the both of them. 

The problem
 

I've had issues with my son on yt. He has caught bad kid videos on there and I limit that screen time to as little as possible. He has access to TV and his nintendo and toys as well. He uses the phone to play roblox. I'm fine with all that, but yt is a sore subject. For game help and certain yt creators it's fine but he drifts off onto the shorts and I'm scared he will he exposed to something inappropriate. So today after doing yt and games he went to play in his room and I told him no yt for tonight, all done. I go to check on him an hour later and he's on yt. Watching something weird. I tell him he was told no, start to go into him going behind my back when my mom comes in and starts a whole rant cutting me off about how there can be bad videos on there and it's not his fault if those come on and yadda yadda yadda. 

I feel really annoyed and shut down by her about my own kid. I tell him no phone tonight n tell him he will have limited time tomorrow because he disobeyed and leave the room. She's in there extra long probably cuddling him about big bag mom.

She comes out into the living room and I tell her without him hearing that I dont appreciate her going off topic when I'm talking to my son about disobeying.

She tells me that if I want him to obey I have to explain it to him why there are dangers. I tell her I already have many, many times before and right then wasn't about the dangers of yt it was about being told no and then doing it anyway. She then remarks that I must not know he's only 8. Oh it pissed me off. I don't say anything and just calm down and then after a few minutes I go into his room and I talk to him about some things are fun on yt, but he needs to watch that in the room with an adult. Screen time is fine but when his time is up on it it's up and to do that behind my back makes me disappointed.  He understands and we hug it out. End of topic.

I go back out in the living room and tell her sorry and tell her I explained to him n she still acts all mad.

AITA? I feel like I might be. But she's also done this before. Sometimes, not every time I scold my kid or correct him she jumps in and tries to change the subject and talk to him about something else. 

I feel like its really rude. He's my kid to parent. I don't spank him, I don't yell, we talk about what he did wrong, why and either clean it up together or if it's really bad a time out. It's rare because he's a really good kid and usually nothing beyond ""hey let's not do that"" is all it takes. Just sometimes something like a breaking of trust is something I want to talk more about. I feel like she acts like she has to jump in or explain to him why I'm scolding him and it's really unneeded. We always talk about it. Either right away or a minute to cool down then talk. 

Am I just being too dramatic about this? Have you dealt with this? I don't want to be rude to her, but it is my house and I have a very good kid because I do parent him well. His father does live here too but is always working or doing his own thing. He's taken on double shifts and does what he wants on his time off. So majority of the parenting is me. I'm mom and dad to our son. Which means nurture and the talking to if needed. To me It feels like my mom is trying to take over the nurturing side entirely and leave me no room to do that n I'm stuck with the discipline side. Making me the bad guy constantly. And cuddling him after I speak to him. 

I'm not the best at being both parents. That's true. But I feel like I should be able to talk to my own kid without her buffering everything I say to him. 

Idk. If I'm being dramatic just please let me know. I tried to be as neutral explaining this as possible but I'm clearly biased to my own side. So take that with what you will.",t5_2qhn3,0,0.33

There are times when he studies and does chores so that's why I just don't mind him playing roblox and doing something he thinks fun during his couple hours of tablet time.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1016qo0/my_husband_thinks_our_daughter_is_terrified_of_me/,My husband thinks our daughter is terrified of me. I've never laid a hand on her...,Kittenknickers333,2023-01-02,1672645220.0,"We have a 5yo little girl with ADHD. She is not medicated. My husband travels for work so I'm left to parent alone 5 days out of the week, sometimes 6. That means I do all the fighting about homework, tooth brushing, bed time and so on. All alone. So far, the consequences of my husband's work has been that I am the bad cop and he the good. He comes in on Friday night with a patience cup full to the brim and therefore, very rarely runs out of patience when it comes to our daughters defiant behavior and big emotions. 

I deal with them as best I can, but obviously, I'm more worn down. Yes, I lose patience and get snippy. I have a tone of voice my daughter calls ""yelling"" and she gets upset when I use it. No I do not raise my voice unless she's across the house and can't hear me. 

Tonight was a Sunday on winter break so we spent the day in just playing games and relaxing. As per usual, my daughter asked me to play roblox with her. I said yes. 

As bed time ran nearer, my daughter began to get upset because I wasn't playing right. This is standard for when we play together. She's extremely controlling and also a sore loser, so if she's not blaming me for making her lose, she's mad at me for not playing like how she wants. When she started getting upset, I told her if she couldn't calm down we would have to stop playing. This is a regular consequence for when she starts having a tantrum. This made her upset and she ran to cry in the hallway. 

My experience with her told me to just leave her alone to work it out by herself. She's doing what I told her to do, calming down. If I try to talk to her while she's in this state, it tends to trigger an even larger tantrum. 

My husband came out of the bathroom and discovered her there. He asked her what was wrong and she told him. We were playing a game and she wanted me to play a certain way and I told her no, I play my way with my computer and she has my laptop to play her own way. We were still in the same game, still playing together, just different ways. My husband tried explaining that to her and she started screaming at the top of her lungs. That's when I decided it was bed time, we will not play if she's going to throw a fit. 

As always, my husband thinks he can handle it so he tells me to feed the dog while he talks to her. I go. When I come back, he has her tucked in bed and very angerly tells me we have to talk about ""how I deal with things"" 

At first he tells me that I have to control myself and not get angry because our daughter is upset. I told him I didn't feel angry because she was upset, i was frustrated. I didn't yell, but I did have a tone when I told her it was bedtime. 

I feel like it's pretty normal to be frustrated when a child is throwing a fit, my husband thinks it's abusive. 

He then told me that she said she was hungry. He told her he'd get her some food, and she said no because I'd be mad at her. The reason she said this is because the rule is no eating after brushing your teeth. We always have to fight her so hard most nights that it's not worth it to have her do it again. My husband came up with this rule himself but since he's not here 70% of the the time, I am the enforcer of that rule, and all rules. She had brushed her teeth and she knew I wouldn't approve of the food. 

I thought this was a normal child worry. No kid wants their parents to be mad. But my husband took this as evidence that my daughter who has never been screamed at or spanked or even slapped on the wrist, is terrified of me. I don't even give this kid time outs anymore! Not since she was 3 and we started suspecting her Adhd! I stick strictly to consequences. She would not have gotten in trouble for eating but yes, I'd get annoyed and make her brush her teeth again. 

I'm so hurt by what my husband said. He thinks that I shouldn't give her any consequences for getting angry at the games either. I should just let her feel her feeling and continue on like nothing happened, even if she screams at me, even if she knocks things off tables and rips up papers. I am to let her do it and because anger is a valid emotion. 

I'm floored, to say the least. I don't even know what to say. I'm here to get some validation that I'm not insane and that I'm not causing trauma to my daughter.",t5_2qhn3,30,0.88
