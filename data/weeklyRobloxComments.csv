I doubt it, I did buy sshf for 140k+ so could it be an anti scam measure? Also my user is Sycthris",j3oma0q,N/A

I have suddenly stopped being able to join private servers through links

(also sorry for the formatting I’m on mobile right now)

Whenever i try join a private server through a link it sends me to the home-screen and nothing loads whatsoever, i’ve waited for 10 mins at the home-screen waiting to join the private server but nothing would happen. 

I have looked on all the threads about private server issues i couldn’t find anything about this issue.

I have checked everything it could possibly be caused by-

:checking my privacy settings
:using a VPN
:restarting my device
:tried it on a different account
:tried it on a different device
:restarting the app

I’ve also 

:tried different links
:waited 20 mins combined for it to load
:tried different games 
:waited 3 hours because i thought it might just need time to update

In conclusion, i’ve tried everything but posting here and this is my last hope to fixing this.",iu5f3nt,N/A

Despite my privacy settings saying ""No one"" can join my games, no matter what server I join, he joins in seconds and will not stop harassing me. Even if I block him, the game is unplayable because he makes his entire focus hunting me down. I don't understand how this is possible. Can someone give insight as to how he might be doing this and how I can stop it?",hoh24q2,N/A

Earlier today I tried to verify my age on Roblox so that I could enable the voice chat. I used my ID card and my verification data got successfully submitted yet there’s still a “verify your age” option in the settings and I can’t find the enable voice chat opinion under privacy settings. Could this be because I’m from Sweden and this option doesn’t work here or what has gone wrong???",hm2psf1,N/A
