My question is: can he actually crash my game and is my pc in any danger?,j9r10yj

Is there a way that I can gift him robux? Or have his grandparents gift them, without logging in to his account?

Right now he does chores and on the 1st of the month I buy them for him, but to do so I log in to his account in a web browser and purchase them like any other microtransaction. Is there an easier way, just using his username?

Also,

He plays the games on his Fire tablet, is there a Windows PC version of the app? Is it the same experience as what he's playing on a tablet?",j6u40b6

I've been looking for answer and waiting for a long time still this issue has not been resolved... this is why I'm asking.

Basically The cursor is oversized aka blurry when you use 125% and 150% dpi scaling setting.

Is there a way to not make it blurry because apparently Roblox doesn't give a crap about windows dpi scaling compatibility setting set to ""Application""",j5p1lpz

My 6 year old nephew is Roblox obsessed. He's asked his parents to enlist me to help ""hack"" the system for him, which I obviously can't and won't do.  I'm just the only computer person they know, so I was the default ask.

But with that said, I thought I would ask the community for help, in terms of what can I learn to do that'll totally impress him? Whether its terms that I should search for or even tutorials.

I've never played Roblox before, but I'm happy to invest a bit of time in this endeavor, it would just be great to get some tips before I get started.

Thank you in advance!",j60fl0w

I recently was reported for ""bullying/harassment"" and I reached out to Roblox to clear some foggy points that made no sense to me. However they've been rather unhelpful to answer my main question as if they're trying to AVOID answering it so I'm hoping someone here can give me a straight answer. Essentially the report showed exactly what I was reported for. What is the ""Offensive Item, you may ask? ""That's funny ash ngl"". I wasn't banned temporarily nor was it a permaban but merely a warning to act as a little slap on the wrist. I'm not complaining about the warning per se, but I genuinely don't understand how ""that's funny ash ngl"" could even WARRANT a warning. And as stated before the Roblox support member was as useful as a warm bottle of piss in the Summer when it came to answering my question. And my question was if Roblox base their punishment SOLELY on the ""Offensive Item"" that they show you or do they also base it on some hidden ones that they (for some reason) don't show you in the report? Because I initially asked if the reports were just reviewed by AI/bots since it made literally NO sense why something like ""that's funny ash ngl"" was enough for Roblox to say ""hEy StOp BuLlYiNg ThE pOoR cHiLd"". The support member answered no that they're all manually reviewed by real people. However when I asked the other question (is the report based off MORE Offensive Items than just the one shown to me) it was like they started sweating bullets and refused to answer that question. So from my perspective, the ""warning"" given to me just seems so flat out arbitrary with literally no justification. So can someone else who apparently doesn't have a gun pointed to their head enlighten me on my situation?

Edit: for more context on the situation, some guy in a room was artificially boosting their rank in the game by using alternate accounts and purposely won against them to make themselves a ""Fake Diamond"". He was essentially farming ELO with himself. I believe that's why I said ""that's funny ash ngl""",ixbk9yf

Both my son's (6 & 4) really enjoy playing Roblox and play a variety of games on it. My husband and I noticed some of the content they were playing wasn't appropriate, so added some parental controls, fine it blocked the content I wanted to be blocked. But it's also blocked some content that they enjoyed playing and was totally fine - basically an Obby where they find cats, markers etc. Any ideas if I can get those unlocked?
