Once I was playing Roblox with my friend and then we left the game when we were finished. I wanted to play a different game and he told me to join him only to find out that he was NOT on my FRIENDS LIST and I couldn't join him anymore! This was very confusing and I tried finding him but I couldn't find him in my friends list so I decided to search for his name in people and found it, only to find out that he was BLOCKED by me! This was beginning to get even more confusing since I never remembered blocking him and we all got along so I didn't think he blocked me!

So then I messaged him on WhatsApp about the issue and he replied that he didn't block me and that he couldn't find me in his friends list either so I decided to tell him to send me a friend request but it told him that 'User is blocked' just like it told me so then we thought that Roblox had made us block each other for no reason! I really want to know a solution or what is happening since we haven't played in a while since this happened in '2022 July' and I could only communicate with him via Whatsapp. I have also tried going into the settings disabling the pin and going to blocked users in privacy tab but he wasn't there and also contacted Roblox but they still haven't gotten back to me with a human response and just a useless support ticket that isn't helping me. So please reply because a response will be very helpful!

I got anxious and complied, followed some tutorial with a copy-paste script, published, and went on with my day. Once again, these games were ARCHIVED and PRIVATED a good five years ago

I log in and my account is terminated for ""phishing."" I try appealing immediately, because wtf, and ""Liam"" explains my account was banned for making a phishing game and that developers are responsible for what they publish. Okaaay?

The games they asked me to edit existed LONG before the time of this ""Trusted Models"" system; I archived them for a reason

Apparently privating and archiving does not do as advertised and I still have no idea which game they are referring to as they refuse context. They expect me to modernize these ancient abandoned games which precede all these new changes and then ban me for getting reasonably anxious and trying to comply? What gives?

I realized I had to go through a bunch of hoops to actually be verified for voice chat, so I went to my settings to see if there was anything I could do to do just that. I heard that you had to be over 13 to use voice chat—which I am—so I went to see the account age I setup for myself first. I clicked on the account age I used when I created the account to see that, for some reason, i had to scroll up to see my actual age in this little menu with different dates. It for some reason started in the 19 hundreds. I quickly scrolled up to 2000, the actual age used when I created the account, but I accidently scrolled passed it and clicked on 2011. Due to this, my Roblox account thinks I'm under 13, so now I can't use voice chat, a feature I could only dream for when I was younger. I immediately contacted Roblox support only to get the email ""We are committed to the safety and privacy of our users. To ensure our users have an optimal experience on our platform, we rely upon the date of birth provided by the user at account signup to customize the restrictions on their account."" I pointed out that this is a clear contradiction, for the account age used when creating the account was set to 2000. If they really did rely on the original age, they'd actually help me, but it doesn't seem like they do. After all, when I pointed out the contradiction, I was repudiated by Roblox customer support.

Head to ROBLOX settings.

Select Privacy settings.

Scroll down and you will see a Tab Box that says, Who can invite me to a VIP server.

Select Everyone instead of Friends.

Click OK to save and apply changes.

The next thing you need to do is Search for players by Username who is playing that game. If you see YouTube streams then it’s going to be easier for you to search the Usernames.

12. O̲t̲h̲e̲r̲ ̲A̲c̲t̲i̲v̲i̲t̲i̲e̲s̲. We remind you of the Rules listed above. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. Here are a couple of other items to keep in mind:

- Offsite website links, services, and additional 3rd party content are not permitted on Roblox with the following exceptions: YouTube, Facebook, Discord, Twitter, Twitch (and such other links that Roblox may subsequently permit). **Roblox may also restrict where any such links may appear within an experience. Users under the age of 13 are not permitted to share any of these links for their privacy and safety.** [...]

---

In short, you asked for someone's Discord, which isn't allowed. It's forbidden because it allows people to contact underage users outside Roblox.",hbshv80,hbryqg3

Works great for me! All I have to do is type ""i"" and my inventory link shows up

It won't save if you're on incognito though or if you changed the privacy settings of your browser

Also, if the other favourites tab saved instead you should be able to remove it from future results somehow (mine has an X on the side)",h3oh0n3,h3ckukt

You can do this by going to their profile page and clicking ""Add Friend"" (Here's a link to your sons profile for example: https://www.roblox.com/users/profile (Link only works if you're logged in)) After you've sent a friend request to one of your sons classmates, they'll have to either go to your sons profile and click ""Accept"" (in place of ""Add Friend"") or go to their friend requests here: https://www.roblox.com/users/friends#!/friend-requests and accept your sons friend request. Repeat this for all your sons classmates using your sons Roblox account.

Next, your sons classmates have to go to their settings by clicking the gear in the top right of their web page then choosing ""Settings"" and going to the ""Privacy"" tab OR you can give them this link: https://www.roblox.com/my/account#!/privacy

Get them to go down to Other Settings and find ""Who can invite me to private servers?"" - set it to ""Everyone"" You son should be able to invite them to his VIP server now.

Now for setting up the VIP server, I'm sure you've managed to already purchase one so I won't explain that. Go to the ""Servers"" tab in the web page of the game you have a VIP for and click the three dots in the far right of your sons vip server and choose ""Configure""

Make sure ""Allow Joining"" is enabled - the button is on the right. It'll be green if it's enabled. Under Allow Joining, there's ""Friends Allowed"" - enable this too.

After that, just to be sure, under Friends Allowed it says ""Server Members"" and to the right a button that says ""Add People"" - click it. Type in the username of your sons classmates and click their username to add them to a list. Repeat this for all of the accounts then click ""Add"" - They should be able to join the VIP server now if they somehow couldn't before.

Recently, Roblox has released display names which are like nicknames. They are different to usernames, so make sure you add **usernames** and not display names. If one of your sons classmates is using a display name, their real username will be the small grey name below the big black name on their profile.

Your classmates should be able to join the VIP server by going to the game page, then going to the ""Servers"" tab and clicking ""Join"" on your sons VIP server.

If somehow they're **_still_** having issues, go back to the configure page for the VIP server and find ""Private Server Link"" - on the right of it should be a button that says ""Generate"" - click it.

A link should appear in the box below. In order to copy it you must click the button that looks like two files in order to select the link, after which you'll either need to press ctrl + c or right click the blue text and choose ""Copy""

You can then send this link to your sons classmates and as long as they're logged in, they'll automatically join the VIP server. It may not work for mobile devices, however I'm not entirely sure about that as I haven't tried recently.

One more thing, each game has a player limit. This means only a certain amount of people can join a single server at a time, and if one server is full a new one is created. (New VIPs are not created) So, if you have more people than the game allows, some people won't be able to join. You can view the player limit below the ""About"" section on the game page, just above there it says ""Private Servers"" (NOT in the Servers tab)

Hope this helps, and isn't too late! :D",h19wqdn,h1691f0

Thank you for contacting Roblox Customer Support regarding your Roblox account PIN.   
We are not able to reset or disable account PINs upon user request. Please be sure to ask your parent or guardian for assistance with the Parental PIN on your account.  
Accounts have the option to add a four-digit Parental PIN to help ensure that the desired account settings are locked in place. Once a PIN is added, it will be needed to make changes to the account info, security and privacy settings. For more information on PINs, see our Account PIN FAQs help article.

Accessing the Parent account and modifying the privacy settings so that ‘Content from other people’ is enabled if you hadn’t done already.

It could also be a NAT issue and if you haven’t done so already, enable ‘UpnP’ inside your router settings.
- Use a PC or Mac that’s connected to the network used by your router to open up your default browser and type the following addresses: 192.168.0.1 & 192.168.1.1 then press enter. Once you arrive at the login screen, go ahead and type in your login credentials. 
- If this is your first time, use ‘admin’ as user and ‘1234’ as password. (Or search for your default login credentials online according to your router model in case these are incorrect.) 
- Now look for ‘advanced menu / NAT Forwarding” and look for the option named UPnP.
- Enable it and save the changes.
- Afterwards reboot both your router and your Xbox One console and see if the Roblox error repeats by attempting to join a game once again.

if you’re trying to sign in with an account originally created on a PC in which the DOB is under 13 years old, you will not be able to join user-created worlds unless you do some privacy adjustments. It would be best to create a new account if all else fails.
