I am here hoping that I can offer help to a family in need with something seemingly insignificant but which could mean the world to them, particularly their son.

My son's best friend recently got locked out of his Roblox account with the message ""For safety and security reasons, your account has been locked, and the password has been reset."" Unfortunately, his parents are not very tech-savvy, and they don't recall which email was used to connect the account with.

To make matters worse, his mother recently started experiencing epileptic seizures, and understandably, they have a lot on their plate. I decided to help out since their son is a big fan of Roblox, and this could provide him some solace during these tough times.

However, my experience with the Roblox support team has been extremely disappointing. I have provided all the information they require, including Google Play payment screenshots, multiple email addresses, and even bank statements. Yet, the communication has now ceased altogether, leaving this family, who has spent over 800 euros on this Roblox account, in a lurch.

I'm reaching out here as a last resort to help them out, and I hope that you can point me in the right direction.

The ""super magent"" gamepass for 4.10 euro is useless shit, you can just max out orb reach in upgrades for gems. The excluisve neon egg is like 5 euro each with only a fucking 1.25% chance in hatching a huge, u could spend even 3,200 robux (32.80 euro) without haching one. The gems price is awful some scam website sells 500m gems for 55 euro FUCK NO!!!!!!.

If the age on the Childs account is set ""13 under"" then they will be subject to play games reccomended for kids. Not only that, but roblox has a chat filtering system to where although they will be able to chat with people, words are filtered through hashtags to block the bad words, and its not just the bad words, Its also an inclusion of hate slander, racism, sensetive topics, etc. Im not 100% sure but I think you could set the account to have your child not to be allowed to use the chat system at all.

My 9-year-old daughter was playing ‘Adopt Me’ when another user asked her if she was interested in trading her flying pet item in exchange for Robucks.

She was curious how much they were offering and joined their party when the user took her “Flying Ghost Bunny” and exited the party.

She’s torn up over it as she didn’t consent to the trade but was curious about the offer. She knows not to talk to strangers online but was curious about the offer.

I don’t feel too terrible seeing her cry over a digital item but I empathize with her being taken advantage of. She’s an innocent child who gets good grades and earns her tablet time.

I know little about how to earn a Flying Ghost Bunny back. I read that it is a limited item and see how it could be a challenge to replace. 

Does anyone know how I could earn one or buy another?

I have never opened roblox studio on this pc, and i currently dont have access to my old pc. This is the issue i encounter when trying to log into roblox studio.i am currently under a 1 day ban (i know, i regret my choices and i will be unbanned eventually)

The thing is, according to google search, if i cant log in to Roblox Studio because of a ban, it should say unauthorised.

I also cant log into roblox studio with my daughter account. Her account is not banned, and can currently play roblox on my computer. (So i am not IP or MAC banned)

The error message when trying to use my daughters account is.

""Login failed""
""An error occured while logging into Studio. Please login on the website or try again later""

When i login via the website it loops this exact same error.

When clicking ""try again"" it asks to confirm the account and continue, upon clicking continue, it returns to the error loop.

Anyone have advice for my situation?

So – It seems that Roblox is making a big effort to get their development in front of kids.  They have a whole section of their website dedicated to teacher outreach including lesson plans.

My son, 7, is very into Roblox, and we spent a good chunk of today (his fall break) developing a Roblox game.  It’s a ridiculous game, just a bunch of random prebuilt items over a weird terrain.  When I went to publish it, it is saying that the age restriction on it is undetermined.

I have his account locked down to the recent parental controls which only allows games that are suitable for all ages.  I caught him on some pretty questionable games, certainly not age appropriate.

When I went to the creator questionnaire, it told me that I basically need 100,000 plays to set the age restriction of my game.  That sucks – so I either remove the parental controls on my 7 year old, or he can not play his own game that he worked hard on.

So – is there some way to get around this not-being-able to set the age restriction myself, or some way to whitelist certain games that aren’t in his permission level?  I’m really stuck here.  If anyone can help, we’d greatly appreciate it.",itar8xz,N/A

first, make sure that your niece’s account is over the age of 13 as there have been new age restriction guidelines introduced, barring accounts under the age of 13 from playing.
Murder Mystery 2 is a game which is not listed, meaning by default, roblox has listed the game as above 13.

so go to settings, parental control and under ‘allowed experiences’, make sure it is set to >13.

secondly, error code 524 can either correspond to joining a private server (server where only whitelisted people are allowed to join) when you do not have permissions to join it, or your niece’s account isn’t 30 days old (was made less than 30 days ago), so make sure your niece is joining a public server or has waited out the thirty day period.

the reason animations are not working on your daughter’s avatar is due to the body type.

your daughter has the r6 avatar (where the arms and legs are straight).

to make animations work, you need to switch to the r15 avatar (where the joints are able to bend).

to do this, go to the avatar menu again.

click on ‘customize’

then go to ‘body’ and scroll until you see ‘build’.

click on it and it will ask you if you would like to switch to r15, click on the white ‘switch’ button.

equip the animations, and see if they function correctly.

since it is a horror genre, please make sure your daughter will not be frightened by the monsters in the maze, and if so there are parental control setting which you can enable to prevent her from joining games like that.

the terms ‘zooming in’ and ‘speed glitch’ are most likely in-game terms, ‘zooming in’ referring to adjusting her camera angle and ‘speed glitch’, which sounds like an in-game bug so her daughter can gain an advantage over the monster.

there isn’t really an objective, but rather just to walk around, talk to people, to ‘roleplay’ (acting out the part of a character) as if you were in a bathroom and find in-game secrets (like a statue of a character) behind different surfaces.

all games come with an ‘age rating’, and that game has an age rating of ‘all ages’, so the game should be fine for your daughter, she may find and interact with people who could make her feel under pressure, or angry within the game.

Hi. I’m curious if anyone can have a suggestion for me. My 11 year old daughter who is autistic loves Roblox and plays daily. She loves Royal High and she had a goal of logging in daily for a year to collect a lot of diamonds. It was a big deal for her. She mentions that there are people/trolls in various games who “report your account for no reason”. She’s said she also plays Brookhaven and often gets requests from other kids to adopt them. I mention the autistic part as she is very shy, is prone to not interact with others and certainly doesn’t engage in arguing. She says she thinks some kids were disappointed because she couldn’t give them what they wanted and said kids reported her out of malice. Today she said someone reported her and her account was locked/banned. She is very sad that she will now lose her year streak to check in for diamonds.

I emailed Roblox support from his account explaining the issue. I verified and restated the problem from my email. I got back a standard ""We don't allow minors to change their age"" response so I replied stating the problem again and have just gotten a ""Sorry, we've given you all the help we can"" answer.

I've been playing roblox ever since I was a kid, for many years now. Roblox keeps their moderation VERY tight and anything considered inappropriate in the slightest probably wouldn't reach your nephew. For the person mentioning ""condos"" in the other reply, those are basically sex games however they usually get taken down within seconds of their creation, so it's not something you should worry about and it probably wouldn't be advertised to your nephew at all. Though, one thing almost everyone has done growing up as a kid playing roblox.. roleplay. I'm betting your nephew might've gotten into it too. Be it a family, police, or dating rp. It may be disturbing to you, but there are some games where kids would rp as lovers or create a family of their own. I'm not gonna say whether this is ""healthy"" or not but I did it as a kid his age and it's very common to see this amongst kids his age in ROBLOX. However, this makes them vulnerable to pedophiles, it's something you really wanna watch out for with that kid and pedos on roblox is something I've been fighting everyday. If he asks to download discord, I suggest only letting him at about 13 or so. 

Lastly, scamming. Scamming on roblox happens too much but is easily avoided. Verify your nephews account with an email or phone number. And teach him that robux is never free and those ""robux generators"" don't work.",ibb2f7k,ib7pevq

Just be cautious whenever you use the toolbox or not use it at all. There are many good items as well as malicious items within the toolbox, but the easiest way to tell apart a bad and a good item is to look at the likes and dislike ratio. If the dislikes are significant or there are no likes or dislikes, it has a repeating name such as ""Tree Tree Tree Tree Tree Tree"", or has no icon, **DO NOT USE IT**. Also, if you want to be extra careful, you can always look up the free model on the roblox library and check if there are any comments about it. Also, as for your roblox appeals responses, it might take a few days for them to actually respond to your appeal and decide on if your son should be unbanned.",ic8le70,ic8jkfs

I entered them thinking its not a scam, It kicked me out of the game, the kick message said ""Wait 24 Hours and your pet will be added to your account""  
  
I waited them.  
  
Tomorrow, when I logged in, I was logged out automatically?! 🤨 When I logged in, I was SHOCKED.  
  
Someone logged in to my account and added a protection pin to stop modifying details. ""It's called a parent pin now"".  
  
He also entered some games.  
  
I immediately contacted ROBLOX Support, they took 1-2 days to respond. (Sadly no live chat.😒)  
  
In the end, Roblox support told me that my online pin was removed and the hacker was ip-banned.  
  
I searched online and found that these type of scams use a discord webhook.  
  
This webhook allows that if the user typed his credentials and clicked login, these credentials are sent to the hackers discord user as a bot, then he logs in to the accounts.  
  
I need advice so I can be careful while entering games.

Me and my niece used to love playing this one fashion/modeling game back in 2019/2020 but we can't remember the name of it and neither of us favorited it so it's lost.

Here's how it worked: while in the lobby, a theme would be chosen for the upcoming round (Christmas, school, purple, etc.). When the round begins, the player's avatar is zoomed in on and a menu appears to the right side of the screen. This menu allows the player to choose anything from Roblox's catalog to use for their outfit, ranging from hairs to clothing to morphs, anything available in the catalog can be used in the game.

 Once you've selected your outfit, the players will be walked onto a stage (automatically, by a guide I'm assuming) where they can now vote on each other's outfits. You can only vote once and not on yourself. After voting finishes, the players walk offstage (again, automatically) and the curtain closes. 

The curtain opens again and the first, second, and third place winners are displayed on pedestals on stage. The round ends, players are transported back to the lobby, and you wait for a new round. Wash, rinse, repeat. 

The reason we loved this game so much was because you could use anything from the catalog rather than select items included by the creator like other games, and because it was so easy to play on mobile. I'd love to find it again so we can play together. Any help is appreciated.",htfwm6p,N/A

She's been asking for her computer back to play Roblox, but I know some of the people she was chatting with are also on there. I know I can turn off chat with parental controls, but what else can I do? Is there a way to keep her from creating a new account without parental controls? Are the parental controls good enough to keep a sneaky kid in line? I was one myself and know there are always ways around things so I'm hesitant to give her anything back at this time and struggling with what to do.",ho260zn,N/A

My daughter likes to play a certain Roblox game, it's the Warrior Cats Ultimate Edition one. For Christmas, she has asked for robucks or something of the sort, something for her to be able to buy certain things within the game.  
The thing is...I'm totally clueless. I had literally never even heard of roblox before she started playing this game (I'm sorry! I was born in 1984 so my idea of gaming is still somewhat colored by memories of Oregon Trail and is mostly now limited to an obsession with anything Zelda)...so I don't want to end up getting her the wrong thing, or something that won't work for her game, that would be a disappointing Christmas present.  
I have seen the version of robucks-type thing sold on Amazon, and judging from the comments, it seems that type doesn't work on everything. I have also now seen gift cards at my local grocery store. I'm wondering...if I buy one of these gift cards, would it work for her, on her game? Does anyone have any experience with the type of thing she needs for that particular game?  
If anyone has any tips or advice for me, I'd be super grateful. Thanks in advance (for advice and for putting up with my cluelessness) and happy gaming!",ho5upm4,N/A

So we've used the parental controls which restrictions which games he can join. That seems all good I think.

Obviously we would prefer him not to see this. Also when we did a search for Thomas the tank engine, nearly every game that came up was restricted.

So I'm wondering if there is a way or setting to ensure that only age appropriate games show up on the home page and in search.

Two reasons, 1 so that he doesn't see anything we don't want to (we are sat with him but still). 
And 2, its really annoying and frustration for him clicking on all these games (thomas the tank) and finding out there restricted. 
If it only showed what was age appropriate / not restricted that would be 100% better.

Today I just hopped on for the first time in years so that I could give them away but to my surprise, every single collectible item I owned was wiped from my inventory completely. Was there something that I missed during my absence where other people experienced the same thing? The last completed trade on my account happened back in 2017 and it was a trade I remembered. Just kind of sad that there's a possibility I lost all these items and I won't be able to hand them over to my niece because I spent so much time on the site and now I don't have as much to show for it.

Alright, so this happened quite a while ago to one of my good friends. He didn't play Roblox for around 2 or 3 weeks, then when he tried to go on it, Roblox locked it for being inactive for too long, and the only way to get back on it was to have Roblox send a password reset email to his email, and when he did, Roblox never sent the email. 

He checked all of his emails and parents' emails to see if it was sent to those just in case it was a different email linked to his account, but alas, nothing. We then tried to contact help, just to them saying he had no proof he owned the account. We couldn't do anything, so we gave up. 

Fast forward to now, I was curious to see if it would work, so I tried logging onto his account, since he gave me the password to it to see what it was all the way back at the start of when this all happened. I log on with all of the correct stuff, and it says password is incorrect. I do it multiple more times to see if I accidentally misspelled it, but nope.

You can do this by going to their profile page and clicking ""Add Friend"" (Here's a link to your sons profile for example: https://www.roblox.com/users/profile (Link only works if you're logged in)) After you've sent a friend request to one of your sons classmates, they'll have to either go to your sons profile and click ""Accept"" (in place of ""Add Friend"") or go to their friend requests here: https://www.roblox.com/users/friends#!/friend-requests and accept your sons friend request. Repeat this for all your sons classmates using your sons Roblox account.

Next, your sons classmates have to go to their settings by clicking the gear in the top right of their web page then choosing ""Settings"" and going to the ""Privacy"" tab OR you can give them this link: https://www.roblox.com/my/account#!/privacy

Get them to go down to Other Settings and find ""Who can invite me to private servers?"" - set it to ""Everyone"" You son should be able to invite them to his VIP server now.

Now for setting up the VIP server, I'm sure you've managed to already purchase one so I won't explain that. Go to the ""Servers"" tab in the web page of the game you have a VIP for and click the three dots in the far right of your sons vip server and choose ""Configure""

Make sure ""Allow Joining"" is enabled - the button is on the right. It'll be green if it's enabled. Under Allow Joining, there's ""Friends Allowed"" - enable this too.

After that, just to be sure, under Friends Allowed it says ""Server Members"" and to the right a button that says ""Add People"" - click it. Type in the username of your sons classmates and click their username to add them to a list. Repeat this for all of the accounts then click ""Add"" - They should be able to join the VIP server now if they somehow couldn't before.

Recently, Roblox has released display names which are like nicknames. They are different to usernames, so make sure you add **usernames** and not display names. If one of your sons classmates is using a display name, their real username will be the small grey name below the big black name on their profile.

Your classmates should be able to join the VIP server by going to the game page, then going to the ""Servers"" tab and clicking ""Join"" on your sons VIP server.

If somehow they're **_still_** having issues, go back to the configure page for the VIP server and find ""Private Server Link"" - on the right of it should be a button that says ""Generate"" - click it.

A link should appear in the box below. In order to copy it you must click the button that looks like two files in order to select the link, after which you'll either need to press ctrl + c or right click the blue text and choose ""Copy""

You can then send this link to your sons classmates and as long as they're logged in, they'll automatically join the VIP server. It may not work for mobile devices, however I'm not entirely sure about that as I haven't tried recently.

One more thing, each game has a player limit. This means only a certain amount of people can join a single server at a time, and if one server is full a new one is created. (New VIPs are not created) So, if you have more people than the game allows, some people won't be able to join. You can view the player limit below the ""About"" section on the game page, just above there it says ""Private Servers"" (NOT in the Servers tab)

I'm hoping I'm in the right place this time.  My 10 yo plays Roblox and has a very small list of friends which is great.  He knows them all which is even better.  For some reason his best friend is claiming that my son is unfriending him and re-friending him.  I don't see where a log of this is at.  I just found out about the Friend Checker game and put my son in there so it starts to create a log, but that doesn't help for anything previously.  His friend claims that he gets a message stating that he was unfriended and that he gets some sort of message saying ""Sorry your friend unfriended you. If this is a bug please contact support.""  

I don't know if I believe that.  My son had 2 extra friends that he didn't know about and before I knew it they were removed and I didn't see a message saying they were unfriended or anything like that.  Is there a log file somewhere?  Other than looking at someone's profile and seeing if you're friended or not, how can you tell if someone unfriended you?  Is there a history, a log, anything that would be useful?  His friend is getting very passive-aggressive about this and I'd like to squash it by knowing what Roblox can and can't do.

Again and again, products she buys get deleted. It merely says [Content deleted], and the item is gone.

I find it hard to believe that Roblox just accepts real money for these 'products' and offers no recompense or refund when these products are deleted. Is this actually true? Is there no way at all to get money back (whether real money or Robux) when a product is deleted?

And secondly, is there a way to decrease the risk of this happening? I suggested she only buy products whose creator is listed as Roblox itself. That the 'private' sellers are less reliable.

Angered by the very **thought** of _flowers_ happily frolicking in the sun, I set off on my quest to destroy their way of life.

I started in another field of flowers and made my way across giant bean stalks. I marched through two seperate fortresses. I encountered a goomba who taught me everything about fighting and promptly poked and slapped it until it died for which I levelled up and got 5 extra hp.

It was at this point that I got fed up of gazing at this horrendous kingdom, full of life and colours, and discovered that I had the ability to run in order to move a lot faster.

I sped through Boggly Woods, ran through the Lush Forest (briefly stopping to eject my lunch) and ended up inside of Mario's house. I know he's a plumber, but I still find it gross that his basement is literally connected to the kingdom's sewers.

Although, the sewers were still considerably less sickening than the other areas I was forced to trudge through previously.

After exploring the sewers, I found myself in the basement of a library. Hoping to find somebody to advise me of the location of Flower Fields, I left the library and found out that it was, in fact, the _castle's_ library.

I spotted Princess Peach herself atop the throne and approached her. ""Princess!"" I said ""You must inform me of the location of Flower Fields! There are many flowers there, happily frolicking in the sun. It is horrendous! They must be annihilated.""

To which she responded, ""NEVER!""

Shocked at this development, I pulled out the bob-omb I kidnapped from one of the fortresses I visited earlier and told her that she WILL tell me the location of Flower Fields or else be decimated.

She then told me that it is not possible for her to be killed. Upon lobbing the creature at her throne, I discovered that that was, indeed, correct. I then informed her that I will someday return with the ability to decimate her and her castle as I retreated back to the sewers, where I encountered King Goomba! Surely King Goomba himself, king of all goombas, would know the location of a place he surely despises no less than I.

I followed him through the sewers and ended up in a dark alleyway in the back of Rogueport. He walked towards some boxes then slowly turned towards me, his large black eyebrows looming through the shadows.

""ye?"" He asked me.

I asked him where I could find Flower Fields, to which he replied -

""idk""

He then walked past me and left the alleyway. Dejected, I walked around Rogueport and boarded what could only be described as a level 100 magikarp which then _flew_ towards Toad Town. As I disembarked the level 100 magikarp, I encountered a yellow rescue toad. It kept saying something about being freed, which had me rather befuddled. Fortunately, I have a vast IQ, and managed to trick it into thinking I was lost and that my home was Flower Fields.

It then told me to follow it and I was finally shown the way to a door which led to Flower Fields. Remembering my manners, I made sure to thank the yellow rescue toad. It then told me I was ""freed"" and left me with the door, which I entered.

The very first thing I noticed as I arrived was that the flowers were not actually frolicking. Just sitting there, rather. Nevertheless, flowers they are and pulverized they must be.

The second thing I noticed was Bowser and his son Larry! Thrilled I would not be undertaking the task myself, I walked up to them and expressed my delight at their presence. Bowser turned to me and roared something I did not quite understand. Upon asking him to repeat it, he said that I heard him and that I ruined his family's picnic. I told him that surely me ruining his picnic is considerably less worse than the flowers continued existance, but he was having none of it and demanded I leave.

Angered yet again, I let him know that I would be returning with an army to flatten the place. Not being foolish however, I did not stay to further anger the ruler of koopas. As I left, Mario (in a car) drove in front of Bowser and ordered a happy meal. It was not long before Bowser was bashing the car to smithereens. Whether that psycho plumber survived is anyone's guess.

To anyone who wants to join my army and lay waste to Flower Fields, follow these directions:

* Enter Toad Town (It's in the direction of the star at spawn's bottom)

* Turn left at the post office

* Turn right at the circle area and go up the path

* Just before you go through the star door, turn right

* Enter door

Together, we will vaporize those who reside in Flower Fields!",gsaz329,grr0ojl

Accessing the Parent account and modifying the privacy settings so that ‘Content from other people’ is enabled if you hadn’t done already.

It could also be a NAT issue and if you haven’t done so already, enable ‘UpnP’ inside your router settings.
- Use a PC or Mac that’s connected to the network used by your router to open up your default browser and type the following addresses: 192.168.0.1 & 192.168.1.1 then press enter. Once you arrive at the login screen, go ahead and type in your login credentials. 
- If this is your first time, use ‘admin’ as user and ‘1234’ as password. (Or search for your default login credentials online according to your router model in case these are incorrect.) 
- Now look for ‘advanced menu / NAT Forwarding” and look for the option named UPnP.
- Enable it and save the changes.
- Afterwards reboot both your router and your Xbox One console and see if the Roblox error repeats by attempting to join a game once again.

if you’re trying to sign in with an account originally created on a PC in which the DOB is under 13 years old, you will not be able to join user-created worlds unless you do some privacy adjustments. It would be best to create a new account if all else fails.

ok, so to preface this, I'm not looking at hacking an account or trying any malicious ways of accessing an account. I've never used roblox and have no interest in it other than my childrens use and hapiness they get from it.

My daughter who lives with her mother created a new account last night, on her android tablet (actually an old phone but no sim card) to play in adopt me, she then traded some fly rides or pets, and stuff to it from her regular account, no idea why, she's only 8.

She logged out on the phone before going to bed, and this morning messaged me upset because she can't remember the password on the new account, she didn't use a phone number as she doesnt have one and skipped what i presume would be the add an email address for password recovery as she also doesnt have an email address yet.

Is there any way to recover the password on her phone. does android store them somewhere? I can't go through the phone myself as I'm not there but i'm seeing her on tuesday so I can look then.

Or is it basically a case of unless she remembers the password she's lost these pets of hers as there's no phone number or email to use with password reset?",gmi1t9i,N/A

Hi, we have 2 PC's in the house and this issue is currently happening on both of them. I've googled it loads to no avail and starting to be at my wit's end trying to fix it for both my own pc and my daughter's pc.

If you open the program and join a game everything will work as intended, but if you leave that game and try to join another from the menus then the game just won't open, and the only way to solve it is by closing down the Roblox app fully and joining it which will work fine.

I've searched online and tried the common fixes for problems listed on the Roblox site, but nothing about this issue specifically.

I can include a quick clip to illustrate what I mean, I can replicate this on 2 PC's, I have tried updating, and also uninstalling and putting a fresh install of Roblox on without success, I'm not even sure how you log a bug ??

But my nephew is the light of my life and I want to be the aunt that just has a mysterious and crazy amount of money to spend on him whenever. My sister told me that he wants Roblox gift cards, and she thought my ""Roblox One Percent"" idea was hilarious. 

I've actually downloaded it to my phone while writing this post so I can play it myself and see what's what. Right now, the only information I really have on in-game purchases was that he ""had 800 Robux, but now [he's] only got 6"". I asked him if he got a lot with 800 or only a little, and he said it was only a little, so I'm trying to gauge it from there. 

And, in fairness, I probably can't get him a billion Roblox, lol, as I do only live paycheck to paycheck currently, but I'd love to be able to get him enough that it'll make his day.

Hi all, this might seem a bit of a low effort but I'm struggling to find an answer.

My kids (8F; 11M) are interstate, and one of the things we can do together (since I can't visit them anymore!) is play online, and Roblox has become our default since their access to technology is mostly mobile and a bit limited.

What I am after is some recommendations of things to play together in somewhat short sessions (like 30 minutes). We've played a few tycoon games (superhero and super mansion) and they seem to enjoy them, but they either can't save or are very limited in their scope, so the continuing play value is low.

For extra points, I''d also like a game where trading (without VIP or anything) is possible, as of course I can spend more time in game than they can, and it'd be good to be able to give them some good stuff occasionally, while not hopefully ruining their levelling.

It's even harder as getting my daughter to engage in something (my son basically wants to blow stuff up!) can be hard.

According to a ROBLOX Wikia page, here is what blocking someone does (take note this could be inaccurate if things have changed since this was last edited, which is also a ""fan wiki""):

Blocking someone disallows these features:

1. Send party invites to friends

2. Chat with their friends (their friends can send chat messages to them, but the blocked user will no longer answer back to him/her)

3. Send private messages to friends or other users

4. Send Friend requests to other players

5. Follow their friends to games they are playing

6. Send trade requests to other players

7. Send clan invites to membership users

8. Send ally requests to a group to partner with them

9. Chat In-game with friends or other players

As you mentioned that they have different usernames when they are following her around, chances are that they are using alternative accounts instead of spending $10 to change their main accounts' names. To disallow them from being able to follow your daughter around into every game, you can change the ""Privacy"" settings she has set from going to the settings gear at the top right of the page.

From there, I would suggest changing the setting called ""Who can join me?"" to either ""Friends"" or ""No one"". This will make it so they are unable to directly join her server from her profile unless they are on her friends list, or if you set it to no one, then nobody will be able to do so.",fq67s1b,fq635v5

I had a little cousin that has this exact problem, the first thing to do is one, change the password then end all sessions so it signs out every computer on that account, two, hook up an email and enable two-step verification (sends you a code that will let you into the account), three, teach your daughter to be safe on the internet and don't trust people besides people she knows in real life. To get the Robux back, contact Roblox support [here](https://www.roblox.com/support), make sure to do the steps before first. Take screenshots of the transaction logs and send them along with the support ticket (use an Imgur link) then they should send the Robux back. If you really really want to you can report the account (Roblox doesn't usually listen to reports although they do listen to support tickets) just go to the account then press the report button, there are instructions there. Hope this helps :3

My son is a regular player of Roblox and as per the purchase history he has been buying Robux. He is confident that he has not made the purchases however they seem to be happening. Here is what I had done:

1. Created his own login on my MacMini so my saved credit card in ApplePay can't be used to Roblox to make automatic robux purchases.
2. Removed any saved card details from Robox - had done it already after the last time this happened.
3. Identiified his Apple login with as a child account where authorisation has to be sought before any AppStore / itunes purchases.

Despite this today I have received notification today of two separate purchases of 800 robux each - this was via iTunes billing notification. He is sure that he has not made any purchases and I am at a loss to understand how this is happening, he has not got access to my credit card or my password to be able to make any purchases.

I don't want to have his Roblox account blocked since he enjoys playing the game with his friends and also since now we have financially invested in the account heavily by all these purchases.

Any idea how all of these transactions are going through and how can I stop them? Is roblox saving details somewhere and making purchases using them when he is browsing or seeing stuff? Some help would be REALLY appreciated here please.

I posted this on its own but have been redirected to this thread.  Apologies if it's the wrong place!

I'm responsible for our weekly family quiz night, and I've been trying to tailor it each week so that it's a bit more relevant to my family than the average general knowledge quiz, e.g. questions about films I know they've all seen etc.

My niece is currently obsessed with Roblox, and I would really like to throw in a question or two that relates. Problem is, I know very little about the game, and I'm struggling to come up with anything based on what I've read online.

I was wondering if you had any suggestions? I would really appreciate any help!",fr8ynac,N/A

When my nephew made the decision he wanted to stay with my parents instead of my brother because of his drinking and stuff, my brother changed the password to my newphew's roblox account and refused to give it back.  Because he was five when he made it, he obviously didn't have an email or anything. So it's under my brother's email.

I'm here and asking two questions. Is there any way to switch over account information from one account to a new account if I have all of the old information?

Me and my daughter were on the roblox website redeeming a giftcard she had and while there I saw some very inappropriate chat conversations between her and another individual. After questioning her on it she claimed to not know this person at all and saying she doesn't talk to anybody on there and doesn't understand why these conversations are taking place.

Now I'm no fool and honestly don't believe any of that but I also don't want to straight up accuse her of lying about something that could possibly be true. I don't play Roblox and I'm not familiar with it at all so I dont know. Her electronics are confiscated for now until I can figure out more and possibly prevent tracks from being covered.

My question for all of you is, is it possible for somebody to be having conversations from her account? Is it possible for conversations to be taking place that she has no knowledge at all of even though she's on the game nearly everyday? I'm fairly certain nobody knows her password or has access to her account because it took us forever to figure out her password when we were trying to redeem the giftcard and it wasn't anything anybody would have without her knowing. She's blaming hackers and everything but I'm skeptical and really need some answers. Please help!",gby5lyq,N/A

Unless someone has direct access to her account, there's absolutely no way for this to be happening. On a side note, most people who try to break into someone's account aim to take valuable items from the account, rather than take it over themselves. Unless your daughter has some incredibly high-profile account(unlikely case), it's unlikely that they'd go around striking up conversations.

For finding evidence, if we assume that they've taken items off the account and transferred it, you can check if there are any suspicious transactions on the account here https://www.roblox.com/My/Money.aspx#/#MyTransactions_tab

If you want to make sure that only your daughter's device/pc is the one connected, go to [settings](https://www.roblox.com/my/account#!/billing), and under security - ""Sign out of all other sessions."" Then setup a pin/2fa if needed.

1. Keep the password unique to ROBLOX. It's a good step that it's complex, but if it has been previously leaked, then there's no one stopping them from logging in.
2. Make sure you or your son gives your ROBLOX password to no one. Not even  official ROBLOX support will ask for your password.
3. Ensure that you do not copy and paste anything suspicious into the URL bar or inspect element console area. This is what enables attackers to take the .ROBLOSECURITY token, like shown in this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4sUIS4hFeE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4sUIS4hFeE) .

The issue with how the accounts work on roblox is that once someone gets the login information, it’s super easy for you to lose access to that account. The way to get a password reset is by having the account linked to an email - if the account isn’t linked or the hacker cha yes the email, you essentially lose all access to getting that account back.

It doesn’t help with your situation now, but in the future there are many ways to protect her account. Make sure to enable two factor authentication so that if someone gets her login information they can’t login unless they have the 2FA code.

For reference: I work in DevOps with deep networking background and in general, know a ton about computers.

Issue: On the 10th after booting the PC my son tried to play Roblox. He gets disconnected within 2-10 seconds of getting into the game. He is able to play on his account from his phone or brother's PC. No other issues on the system.

Steps tried:

1. I have reinstalled Roblox to include wiping out the cache is appdata.
2. Reinstalled network driver.
3. Created a new user account.
4. Checked all network settings to include DNS. Also, have a network level override of DNS at the homes firewall so DNS hijacking is effectively impossible. Also checked host file and static routes. 
5. Checked for malware, none found by Bitdefender.
6. We just tested and he is able to play Roblox using the Windows Store App. I'm sure this is a clue just not sure for what yet. This is a good temp fix but doesn't fix studios for him.
7. It appears that on the 9th the Roblox version was 1.6.0.406105 and then on the 10th it was 1.6.0.406474. I'm not sure about this fact as I'm not 100% sure the information recording in my monitoring software is the version number.
8. I can tell from the monitoring software I use that he made no changes or installed anything. It does not show if windows did anything, however.
9. I have also tried logging in my account on his system from the same and different local user accounts.

The next step is to backup and then check the registry. Beyond that, unless someone here has a suggestion it's the old wipe and reinstall Windows. I'd rather not go that route but... hehe, it'll teach him to use the network share drive I made for each family member.

Going back to item 6 for a moment, I usually have the opposite issue where dot net apps will break because one of my dev/networking tools is doing something to the network traffic ie injecting a proxy with a self-signed cert or something.

I'll leave this open until Sunday. After that going to do a wipe. Hopefully one of you kind folk has a solution or something that points me in the right direction.

You need to contact at Roblox support, and after an automated message, they will email you as if you’re under 13. So they will ask you to tell your parent/guardian to submit a ticket referencing their email. You should resubmit your help request and reference your ticket again, but change your name and say you are requesting on behalf of your child for their date of birth to be changed. (I had a 10+email argument with one person who refused to help me after I told them 4 times that I’m not under 13 and I was hacked. I’m convinced that they don’t actually read the requests, or they may do this because of the COPPA law to protect children.)

Anyways, once they respond from the email from your “parent/guardian”, they will ask you for proof of ownership. When you provide that, they eventually ask you to call a phone number and leave a voicemail explaining why you need to change your account age. I assume this is also to stop children from changing their account age to 13+ when they’re under 13.

My son, who is 8 years old, loves Roblox. But tonight, something happened that made him quite upset. And since I know next to nothing about this game, I need some advice. He said he was playing a game called ""Escape McDonalds Obby Parkour"", and when he was about to jump, he said something popped up that caused him to purchase a ""unicorn thing"" (his words) using his robux, which he didn't want but apparently the button for jump is the same button to purchase, so it took 649 robux from his balance and when he exited the game, he no longer had this ""thing"" he purchased.

He was quite upset because he accidentally bought something he didn't want and now doesn't have. Is what he is telling me accurate? Can this happen? Is there anything he (or I) can do to correct what seems to be a mistake, a bug - or worse, an intentional trick to get robux (which equate to real $) from a child.

I was very saddened to hear that my son was ripped off from playing roblox, every week we put 6 dollars worth of roblox so he can play with his cousin from afar. He was ripped off something about ""legendary"" pets ie chocolate labrador dogs and other pets which he spent weeks taking care off. He was doing a ""trust trade"" where he offered the pets and the other player went dark on him and didn't get anything in return and he cried about it. That 6 dollars every week was his allowance that we have him for the last 3 months while not a lot of money it's also very disappointing that there isn't a mechanism in place to protect players from these trust trades. Maybe I'm not understanding how it all works but at the end he still lost what he earned and from what he's been working on.

I would be concerned about the fact Roblox is using a lot of the CPU and that it ran the whole night. For me, Roblox rarely actually runs behind the scenes. Make sure you follow these steps:  


1| Scan your PC with an antivirus. (i recommend paid)  
2| Re-install Roblox Client and Studio from the official Roblox website. ([www.roblox.com](https://www.roblox.com))  
3| Ask if your son has been in any ""free robux/bc"" websites or anything that could silently download a virus.

He only got his friend's account, didn't give his, and has no other way to reach him. His friend hasn't confirmed since, a few weeks now, so he wanted to try to reach him to let him know it's him.

How old does the IP have to be before it's considered part of an account vs a hacker? What if a hacker were to get into my account and I didn't notice I was missing items until a week later? I could contact support and get my items restored, then the hacker can come in later and still use the same supposed social engineering tactics to get into my account, and the request was made from a previous IP.

And again, what about mobile users who may have changing IPs every time they change data cell towers? Or parents who contact on behalf of the child from a different location? Again, making it a steadfast rule would create a lot of problems for the already overworked support team. Imagine trying to explain to thousands of parents about IP addresses and why they can't recover the account. I actually think the ""vast majority"" of Roblox users are  mobile users who may run into this issue fairly often. Hell, nearly half of the people browsing /r/Roblox are mobile users.

For IP bans, isn't it still another issue of ""Roblox making developers do the work"" if developers still need to detect, verify, and ban exploiters? It's fine if it's another tool to use, but it would still come down to the individual developers to implement in their own way. If you say that developer-made anti-exploit becomes ""outdated"" quickly, then IP bans will not solve this.

Still, is support team social engineering really the #1 problem? Most users lose their account due to basic social engineering of ""free robux"" or whatever. Time could be much better spent on working on methods that do not interfere with the user, such as educating users more thouroughly, or requiring users to complete a special game before being able to chat (I doubt most bot networks will dedicate the resources to run thousands of instances of Roblox to complete a game, just to be able to chat)

&#x200B;

Claiming still that ""Roblox is doing nothing"" is incredibly naive. Do you really think they're just sitting on their asses? Do you think they go ""Man, people hate this"" and don't think ""This is cutting into our bottom line""  


They know. They're working on it. But again, there are *so many* reasons why it's not as simple as ""just secure it."" I previously mentioned how Roblox doesn't work on Linux because of anti-cheat. Imagine if Roblox implemented more anti-cheat that stopped certain Android models from connecting. Or caused 5% more CPU usage with a userbase who usually gets hand-me-down computers or cheap mobile phones. Or the privacy issues about anti-cheat that can detect other programs running on a CHILD'S computer just to try to stop cheats. (Can you imagine the fallout if Roblox keeps track of what other programs a child has installed on their computer, if they're running it while playing Roblox, and Roblox saving this information? Many other anti-cheats do this, but usually for M rated games where users under 13 do not or can not play.) Or adding something that breaks a lot of games, like FE originally did ages ago. Just like with IP addresses, there is always a lot of ""What if's"" with anti-cheat and the potential for false flags.

So far you're proposing grand ideas, but seem to have no idea the specifics of the engine or development, or anticipating problems early to try to figure out what could go wrong and fix it. I can almost guarantee that someone at Roblox said the same things, and another developer stepped in with ""That's a good idea in theory, but in practice it'll have issues with X or Y or Z, so it isn't entirely viable."" Or worse yet, someone proposing an idea and it's shot down with ""We tried that already"" or ""That'll work but it's easily worked around, so we shouldn't spend our time on it.""",glibm09,gli2yas

I've been changing passwords and fixing account settings on newly spun up virtual machines at work:

&#x200B;

My naive younger brother who is 10 years old recently gave his password out to a scammer on Roblox. The account didn't have any PIN or 2-step verification set up on it, sadly. Roblox Support came in and reset it back to the original email (My email) and I changed the password, and added a PIN to the account so the information couldn't be edited without it. I did all of this on my computer at work, fearing that one of my home computers had a keylogger or something on it. I never typed the PIN again after setting it.

Later that day, the hacker somehow gets control of the account. My brother has a second account, logs onto it and has a brief message exchange with his main account which is hacked. The hacker was irritated that the password was changed and continued to taunt him with his account.

I email Roblox support AGAIN. They reset the accounts email back to my email. Immediately while at work, on a fresh virtual machine, I log onto Roblox, change the password to something randomly generated, set the PIN to something else, AND set up 2-step verification. And for good measure, I clicked the button that signs the account out of all other sessions. I get home from work a few hours later and the hacker has once again taken the account, before we've even typed any passwords at home. What the hell man? How is this possible?

The ONLY way I think they would've gotten it was if they have my email. The email I've been using for the account hasn't had it's password typed in months and it's a difficult password (12 characters random letters and punctuation). It's been sitting logged in on the machine my son was playing on. But if someone really got a virus or something onto that machine I'm sure they'd be hacking way more than just Roblox. Plus I saw the Chat messages when my brother originally got scammed after getting the account back, all he gave was the Roblox password. So I am 99% SURE the email isn't compromised. But just to be safe, I have reset the email password, and gave roblox my work email instead for them to change the account email to. So let's see what happens tomorrow?

I have played online games since 2000 and I've NEVER had an issue with a hacker like this. I honestly feel like Roblox's site is poorly developed.

Has anyone had any similar issues?

&#x200B;

A side note that makes this interesting, since my brother has two accounts and plays both on the same computer, the hacker cannot and hasn't gotten access to the other account. So it really makes me think that our home machines aren't compromised in any way, just his account.",f9lnws0,N/A

When she opens any game, the same thing happens. The game window opens, stays completely blank (white screen), but there is sound. She is in the game, because other users can see her. The mouse pointer disappears whenever it is over the blank game window. We have tried numerous browsers and have uninstalled/reinstalled several times. Has anyone else had this issue?",fb6jf16,N/A

Is there anyway to find the password that is stored on the PC in the Roblox Player? We tried contacting the customer support, they said they can't help without verifying the account. (I wonder if it's possible to verify the account with them by providing our IP address, since the account has only been accessed through the same PC in the house.)",f4hhzae,N/A

Sounds like your nephew is playing Roblox games made to scam players. These types of games are actually quite frowned upon. Generally, if he plays any of the games on the front page, the popups won't be as persistent since they're considered as more legit games and won't beg for money as much.",f4jkwqx,f4ichxz

If I remember correctly Roblox is trying to change something loosely related to this as soon as they can (within the next 5 years (there's a lot of cool technical stuff they want to add to Roblox Studio & they're supporting a growing playerbase in Asia first) on a timeline they showed during RDC 2019).

If you haven't you should let your nephew know he can press cancel on any transactions popups instead of trying to purchase everything.",f4jszbc,f4jlshk

My son has been using Roblox on my Xbox for awhile now and has bought some items over time for the Roblox Account. He has his own Xbox but his friend calls most days and uses my sons Xbox while my son uses mine. They are set up in the same room.

I didn’t know much about Roblox and now I would like to reclaim my Xbox and get a different one to replace my one in that room but is it possible to transfer over his Roblox profile to the new Xbox as the character he used on my Xbox is the one where the most content was purchased in game.

I don’t game share with him so can’t do anything that way as I game share with my friend years now.

Is it possible for me to let him use my Xbox Profile on the new one and then at night when he is gone to bed, use my profile on the Xbox where I have game sharing set up?",f2ocxmt,N/A
