I am here hoping that I can offer help to a family in need with something seemingly insignificant but which could mean the world to them, particularly their son.

My son's best friend recently got locked out of his Roblox account with the message ""For safety and security reasons, your account has been locked, and the password has been reset."" Unfortunately, his parents are not very tech-savvy, and they don't recall which email was used to connect the account with.

To make matters worse, his mother recently started experiencing epileptic seizures, and understandably, they have a lot on their plate. I decided to help out since their son is a big fan of Roblox, and this could provide him some solace during these tough times.

However, my experience with the Roblox support team has been extremely disappointing. I have provided all the information they require, including Google Play payment screenshots, multiple email addresses, and even bank statements. Yet, the communication has now ceased altogether, leaving this family, who has spent over 800 euros on this Roblox account, in a lurch.

I'm reaching out here as a last resort to help them out, and I hope that you can point me in the right direction.

Thanks in advance!

In my opinon i consider pet sim x a pay to win and gambling game. I not sure if gambling robux breaks Roblox TOS . Pet sim x gamepasses are just SHIT, like the ""hatch three eggs at once"" gamepass is like 8.20 euro HELL NO, TO EXPENSIVE, not worth it!!! The ""super magent"" gamepass for 4.10 euro is useless shit, you can just max out orb reach in upgrades for gems. The excluisve neon egg is like 5 euro each with only a fucking 1.25% chance in hatching a huge, u could spend even 3,200 robux (32.80 euro) without haching one. The gems price is awful some scam website sells 500m gems for 55 euro FUCK NO!!!!!!.

You can rebirth after so long and there's an auto run feature. I'm not sure if anything of what I said narrows anything down.

In each run, there are like transparent walls you run through with numbers on them and after you pass through them, your speed goes up. That's pretty much all that I remember.

As long as you set up parental controls on the child's account which im sure you can find out how to do that through YouTube or their FAQ's page, then you can let them run wild. If the age on the Childs account is set ""13 under"" then they will be subject to play games reccomended for kids. Not only that, but roblox has a chat filtering system to where although they will be able to chat with people, words are filtered through hashtags to block the bad words, and its not just the bad words, Its also an inclusion of hate slander, racism, sensetive topics, etc. Im not 100% sure but I think you could set the account to have your child not to be allowed to use the chat system at all. But I will assure you that there are millions of kids younger than 13  that set their account to be over 13 to be able to access al the games and features base roblox comes with. When I was a kid I did the same thing, and I can assure you I had no innapropriate issues when It came to the chat system or how the games are. Especially for kids, roblox is a stellar outlet for kids creativity. It influences ideas with games that fall under the category of Building, Survival Tactics, Social Skills, Fashion, things like that.

I'm not complaining about the warning per se, but I genuinely don't understand how ""that's funny ash ngl"" could even WARRANT a warning. And as stated before the Roblox support member was as useful as a warm bottle of piss in the Summer when it came to answering my question. And my question was if Roblox base their punishment SOLELY on the ""Offensive Item"" that they show you or do they also base it on some hidden ones that they (for some reason) don't show you in the report? Because I initially asked if the reports were just reviewed by AI/bots since it made literally NO sense why something like ""that's funny ash ngl"" was enough for Roblox to say ""hEy StOp BuLlYiNg ThE pOoR cHiLd"". The support member answered no that they're all manually reviewed by real people. However when I asked the other question (is the report based off MORE Offensive Items than just the one shown to me) it was like they started sweating bullets and refused to answer that question. So from my perspective, the ""warning"" given to me just seems so flat out arbitrary with literally no justification. So can someone else who apparently doesn't have a gun pointed to their head enlighten me on my situation?

Edit: for more context on the situation, some guy in a room was artificially boosting their rank in the game by using alternate accounts and purposely won against them to make themselves a ""Fake Diamond"". He was essentially farming ELO with himself. I believe that's why I said ""that's funny ash ngl""",ixbk9yf,N/A

Anyone have advice for my situation?

So – It seems that Roblox is making a big effort to get their development in front of kids.  They have a whole section of their website dedicated to teacher outreach including lesson plans.

My son, 7, is very into Roblox, and we spent a good chunk of today (his fall break) developing a Roblox game.  It’s a ridiculous game, just a bunch of random prebuilt items over a weird terrain.  When I went to publish it, it is saying that the age restriction on it is undetermined.

I have his account locked down to the recent parental controls which only allows games that are suitable for all ages.  I caught him on some pretty questionable games, certainly not age appropriate.

When I went to the creator questionnaire, it told me that I basically need 100,000 plays to set the age restriction of my game.  That sucks – so I either remove the parental controls on my 7 year old, or he can not play his own game that he worked hard on.

So – is there some way to get around this not-being-able to set the age restriction myself, or some way to whitelist certain games that aren’t in his permission level?  I’m really stuck here.  If anyone can help, we’d greatly appreciate it.",itar8xz,N/A

I'm playing Roblox on PC using the Xbox App. My PC is more than capable of running the game and I have never had any problem running the game in the past (3060ti, 32gb ram, i9 10th gen, etc.). As far as I'm aware, all drivers and related apps are up to date . The stop code I receive varies from time to time, but most of them refer to out of date Windows drivers or malware. Starting to get concerned. Roblox is the only app I've had this problem with. Anyone else have a similar issue or know how to fix? To be clear, game runs perfectly fine for a period of time, anywhere from 30m to a couple hours, and then crashing my entire PC out of nowhere for no apparent reason. Especially frustrating in games like Dungeon Quest or Aimblox where not completing the match is a huge waste of time. Thanks in advance.",imejmf3,N/A

1- now whenever I try to load any game, my assets take an absolute eternity to load  
one reason I can think of is that Roblox is in my C drive (which is apparently really crowded, idk why)  
is there ANY way to change the directory of it ? I am using the beta version so it SHOULD work.  
if that isn't the reason it's so goddamn slow loading the assets, please tell me what can be the cause of this problem and what can be a good fix, any help is appreciated.  
2- teleporting takes an awful amount of time in the experience I play the most (YBA)  
I know enough not of the details of this, all I know is that it takes 20 seconds (SBR has probably started by then)  
  
these problems only appear on of my 2 PC's, the one without any of these problems, sadly I do not have access to it most of the time

In the end, Roblox support told me that my online pin was removed and the hacker was ip-banned.

This webhook allows that if the user typed his credentials and clicked login, these credentials are sent to the hackers discord user as a bot, then he logs in to the accounts.

I guess since you think Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player) works to get the *player*, you think script.Parent.MouseButton1Up:Connect(function(player) works. 

The reason Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player) works because PlayerAdded output the actual player to the connected function. However, in MouseButton1Up, it output x and y coordinate of where your mouse cursor is. So the player in your script actually x y coordinate of the mouse, not the player itself. If you print out *player*, i.e:

    script.Parent.MouseButton1Up:Connect(function(player)
        print(player)
    end)

To fix it, try this edit:

    script.Parent.MouseButton1Up:Connect(function()       
        local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer 
        local souls = player:WaitForChild(""leaderstats""):WaitForChild(""Souls"")
    [remaining script here]

btw you should use localScript if you haven't already. Otherwise the script won't work. Also, **S**ouls is different from **s**ouls. if you have orangeish yellow color error something along infinite yield, try WaitForChild(""souls"") and WaitForChild(""qu"")",i14x3te,i0wzlw5

Hi, i want to pass some robux to my little sister, so far we have tried her selling t shirts/gamepasses, but that means she will have to pay 70% from just selling it which is crazy…
iv also tried opening a group, but apparently i need to get some group funds in it which im not really sure how to…

my question is, how do i give my sister robux without any of us losing 70% of money?",hz5heof,N/A

I tried accomplishing it by spawning another frame below the first one, then telling the button to turn the frame invisible after a second, then, using MouseMoved in the frame below it to see if the mouse above it is moving, and if it is, turn the frame visible again and then running the usual script.Parent.MouseLeave:Connect(function() script.Parent.Visible = false end) however, that feels choppy and won’t work if the player’s mouse is still so I dont want to use it I also had some ideas with GetDescendants but they didnt go anywhere I can also technically brute force it by not doing anything past script.Parent.MouseEnter:Connect(function() script.Parent.Visible = true end) and then just telling the other buttons to remove all the other frames when a mouse is hovering over them but again (ideally) I want the frame to disappear after the mouse leaves, so that’s pretty much a last resort.",hxn14z4,N/A

Please read below my appeal to the moderation team:

*I have just had my account permanently deleted from Roblox for my third strike DMCA violation. This is the third strike I have received in regards to a 'Ralph Lauren' themed product. Following my second strike, I removed all the clothing from my group store. This was, apparently, not enough to prevent a third and final strike.*

*This is the equivalent of criminalising smoking and then locking up everyone that ever smoked a cigarette even when it was legal. If the items were not permitted to be on Roblox then your moderation team should not have accepted them.*

*I request that my account be reinstated and that this strike be wiped from my record. I should not be punished for something that, at the time of its occurrence, was permitted.*

I’m 23, and I kept explaining that to Roblox support that I would like to submit my state ID to them to verify my identity.  They kept telling me they cannot change the age, so I thought I would mention the fact that my account was hacked a few months back.  Apparently this gave someone the green light to completely remove the email and passwords from my account, and now I am lost.

That account means a lot to me and I would do anything for Roblox support to actually help me.  I found a support phone number online but it asked me to leave a message.  I hope they actually get back to me.

The thing is...I'm totally clueless. I had literally never even heard of roblox before she started playing this game (I'm sorry!

When I created my Roblox account 2015 (when I was 10 years old) I put down my date of birth to 2015 instead of 2005 because my stupid 10 year old head thought that I was suppose to put in the current year.    
This means that Roblox thinks I am 6 years old and is restricting me from using vc, many words in chat, along with many other features ALL on my main account. In other words, I am going to have to wait 7 years to be able to change the year of birth to the correct as you need to be 13 to change it, even with ""Parent's email"". If I wait, I will be 24 by the time I can change it to the correct year. I have tried time and time again to ask the support for help. This includes me telling my actual problem and many arguments to why I need it fixed and telling them about my passport (as they can confirm that via vc now).  


It has gone way to far and I have given up and am forced to use an alt account that don't even have a year of progress whilst my Main has 6 years of progress on many games.   
I am asking any soul out there for help, advice even. I have no hope left and so I rest my broken curse for you to cure in a last ditch effort.

So we've used the parental controls which restrictions which games he can join. That seems all good I think.

When we are now on the home page in the ""recommended for you"" as an example there's still loads of squid game and other mild horror game titles showing. Obviously we would prefer him not to see this. Also when we did a search for Thomas the tank engine, nearly every game that came up was restricted.

So I'm wondering if there is a way or setting to ensure that only age appropriate games show up on the home page and in search.

Two reasons, 1 so that he doesn't see anything we don't want to (we are sat with him but still). 
And 2, its really annoying and frustration for him clicking on all these games (thomas the tank) and finding out there restricted. 
If it only showed what was age appropriate / not restricted that would be 100% better.

I thought it was the typical visual glitch but it wasn't, so I checked transactions and apparently it says a gamepass was bought for 1,522 robux, which was the amount I had.  
  
Now to clear things up, my account was set with 2fa and a pin a long time ago, a very long password as well. after the incident I checked my emails for any attempted connections and I found nothing. I also clicked on no weird links, or scams, since I was inactive for that long anyway so I highly doubt it was a cookielog.

The only thing which could be the culprit is I had 2 roblox related extensions for chrome, mainly BTRoblox and RoPro. I was skeptical about these two so I removed them after just in case they might be the cause.  
  
I checked the account where it was selling the gamepass, and it seemed like a regular user, not an alt. however, their owned games had a vip server purchase option enabled with a high number amount of robux (\~6k), and the gamepass cost amount changed from 1,522 to 658.  
  
What is the meaning of this? Did this person or bot get into my account bypassing every security? or is there a website vulnerability which allows you to see people's amount of robux, and steal it somehow?

Accessing the Parent account and modifying the privacy settings so that ‘Content from other people’ is enabled if you hadn’t done already.

It could also be a NAT issue and if you haven’t done so already, enable ‘UpnP’ inside your router settings.
- Use a PC or Mac that’s connected to the network used by your router to open up your default browser and type the following addresses: 192.168.0.1 & 192.168.1.1 then press enter. Once you arrive at the login screen, go ahead and type in your login credentials. 
- If this is your first time, use ‘admin’ as user and ‘1234’ as password. (Or search for your default login credentials online according to your router model in case these are incorrect.) 
- Now look for ‘advanced menu / NAT Forwarding” and look for the option named UPnP.
- Enable it and save the changes.
- Afterwards reboot both your router and your Xbox One console and see if the Roblox error repeats by attempting to join a game once again.

if you’re trying to sign in with an account originally created on a PC in which the DOB is under 13 years old, you will not be able to join user-created worlds unless you do some privacy adjustments. It would be best to create a new account if all else fails.

In most of the games I've played, the creators made scripts that converted decal IDs to image IDs. It's apparently kinda complicated.

Putting decals in studio works great!

I also looked at [this thread I found](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/its-impossible-to-get-an-image-id-from-a-decal-id/847125) and tyridge77 points out that if you have the BTRoblox extension, you can click a button next to the three dots and it'll change the URL to the image ID instead. I tried it myself and that works too, so u/Glad-Faithlessness-3 can get that that extension if you don't want to open studio!

I believe [this is the extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/btroblox-making-roblox-be/hbkpclpemjeibhioopcebchdmohaieln) if you're interested

I went into my ROBLOX game and used dev console to test ways to change the texture of a decal. The image ID changed up to 50 at least in some cases, so it's more than 1-5. This is what finally worked: **game.Workspace.Part.Decal.Texture = ""rbxassetid://ImageIDHere""**

So you can do that if you need to change it using dev console, but you'll need to get the image ID first using either studio or BTRoblox.",gvss91l,gvrx6cy

I  looked at the links they gave and they weren't much help. I didn't even know what a datastore was until I got this message. I'm not a very advanced builder and none of my games require any user data to be stored, as they're basically just scenic places and the only scripts they have in them just do things like affect the environment/models/etc and don't store any kind of data as far as I'm aware.

I've tried following the steps on [https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/managing-personal-information](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/managing-personal-information), and while I get the console output saying the data has been removed, I  don't know if it actually removed it, because you can put anything in, even 0 or a bunch of letters, and it'll still say it removed the data.

I've  also tried a few different plugins to get into these datastores and so far I haven't been able to do anything because I don't know the names of  my datastores. For example I've tried connecting to ServerStorage, PlayerData, PlayerId, etc and tried keys like Player\_XXXXXXXXXX, all with no results.

I have no idea what I'm doing and it's seriously stressing me out because apparently if you don't remove the data you can either be fined or have your account deleted.

So, my main question is: Are datastores even enabled by default and if so what info do they  store? What are the default names of the datastores and keys and how  would I go about deleting all of a user's data from them?

I played Phantom Forces to determine if I'm insane or this is an actual problem.

While playing the game, the stats say that I'm averaging 60fps, but my screen looks like I'm playing on 30fps or below that, the smoothness being really inconsistent.

And so I went to my display's settings and changed my refresh rate from 144hz to 60hz. The problem seems to have gone away, the game running much smoother, and Phantom Forces still telling me that I average 60fps.

While the problem is gone, the game will lag severely in cluttered areas while my fps stays at 60 and a big transparent green outline appears around objects when I move my camera really fast (kinda like a motion blur)

My PC should have no problem running roblox with an RTX 2070 Super and i7 9700k.

My question is if this is normal, and is there any other solution to this except for changing my refresh rate each time to 60hz?",g87v8f4,N/A

Dear people of this subreddit,

This is my first post on this subreddit. I am relatively new to reddit but I am slowly understanding it more and more. My roblox username is: **nickp2003** and I have recently been either hacked or scammed or something similar. I usually play roblox every other day and so the last time I played was Monday. Yesterday 5/19/20, I have apparently traded with a user named: **xansrock**. He took some of my most valued items and got them to himself. I have no idea how he did it but somehow he did. I contacted support about it and I am awaiting a reply. I am just hoping this all can be resolved and I can get my stuff back. I always decline trade requests because I like the stuff I have. If you users can help me look further into this and bring this user to justice, that would be greatly appreciated.

From a Roblox user to a whole community

Thank you,

group funds issue

\----------------------------------

hi! this is my first time posting on here but i have an issue with my group funds.

basically, last night someone bought a developer product from my game (which links to the group, so the funds would go to the group) at 7:35 PM EST. however, when i checked the trasactions instead of the robux being pending it was already all black and there was no timer, like it would be if it was done pending. it also does not show up in the pending funds/group funds/my personal robux. i know that it works because other people have bought things from me and it has went into the pending section.

i also had a reoccurring payout that i put before he bought but after other people bought, so i am wondering if they interfered with the robux, however the robux isn't showing up on the account that the reoccurring payout is going to.

so basically my question is: what happened to the robux?!

tl;dr - i had a person buy something from me in my group and the robux isn't showing up in pending funds and shows up like it was already done pending",fztw7sv,N/A

I made a post a while ago on a different subreddit that never really got any attention so it never got fixed, and I have tried many things to get this to work.

For some reason, roblox crashes my computer by forcibly restarting it for no apparent reason. It shouldn't be my graphics card since I have a Nvidia GeForce 1660 ti and I was able to run the COD Cold War beta just fine. I attached a screenshot of the analytics in-game and a snipit of my Nitrosense information.

On Roblox, the graphics card and everything is doing fine; well, everything except for RAM. Seems like it isn't having a good time up there.

On Nitrosense, my graphics card has no idea how hard it needs to work for roblox; it jumps up and down with percentage used, ranging anywhere from 5% up to like 60%. But, as you may recall, roblox thinks the graphics card is doing just dandy.

I am at a loss guys, so hopefully another person had a similar issue and can tell me what to do.

Thanks!

You need to contact at Roblox support, and after an automated message, they will email you as if you’re under 13. So they will ask you to tell your parent/guardian to submit a ticket referencing their email. You should resubmit your help request and reference your ticket again, but change your name and say you are requesting on behalf of your child for their date of birth to be changed. (I had a 10+email argument with one person who refused to help me after I told them 4 times that I’m not under 13 and I was hacked. I’m convinced that they don’t actually read the requests, or they may do this because of the COPPA law to protect children.)

Anyways, once they respond from the email from your “parent/guardian”, they will ask you for proof of ownership. When you provide that, they eventually ask you to call a phone number and leave a voicemail explaining why you need to change your account age. I assume this is also to stop children from changing their account age to 13+ when they’re under 13.

Details include:

* A selection of various characters you could play as, one of them wearing black, bulky armor. Each character also sported abilities that made them distinctive from the rest.
* Unique maps that are chosen randomly such as an underground facility and a village within a black canyon.
* The songs were different from each map (I believe?) with one of them being Caramelldansen.

The ""Unable to cast to dictionary"" is occurring because you haven't defined what property will be changed to ""Closed"", and in addition to this, you need to set the goal to the Value of Closed, so assuming once again, that ""Closed"" is in fact a Vector3Value, it would change to ""**script.Parent.Parent.A (or B).Closed.Value**"". If you do not set it to the value of what you have set, you will simply be referencing it and not checking the data that it contains.

In what you have provided, you also are not playing the Tween, only creating the information for which you would then be able to store in a variable (such as local Tween = TweenService:Create(etc.)) and then do Tween:Play() afterwards. Along with this, you are overriding the Value in lines 9 and 10, which I'm not entirely sure if it is intentional or not (I will define a separate Tween so that it's not constantly overriding values).

I, personally, set it up a bit differently, so here's an example using the references you've created in your script:

(Also, unless you're going to be doing something with the data that gets passed through the parameter ""blar"", such as figuring out who clicked it, I don't think you need to have it there.

Go into ROBLOX Studio --> Click the ""View"" tab at the top left --> Enable ""Game Explorer"" --> Right click the ""Places"" section in the new GUI that appears --> Click ""Add new place"" (this will create what I believe is called a ""Multi-Place Game/Universe"").

Now, you should see two places inside of that folder. If you would like to confirm that the new place is not accessible outside of this game, you can right click the Places folder and click ""Game Settings"", then click the ""Places"" tab on the left side of the page. If you try to click the connected place, it will bring you back to the page of the one you will start in, which in your case, would be the lobby.

From here, we need to add in something that will allow you to teleport to that place. Since we are doing it through touching a brick in the Workspace, we'll need to use a Script that involves a .Touched function to check when someone touches it so they are teleported. Insert a script inside of the part that will teleport people (you can also put this into the ServerScriptService, but you will need to reference the brick differently, then). Here's the script I wrote up that has comments in it to explain what each thing does. I'll also explain it afterwards.

*(Sorry if it is poorly formatted in Reddit. Not as intuitive as a place like the Developer Forum/Discord even.)*

```

    local Players = game:GetService(""Players"") -- Defines ""Players"" as the Service in the Explorer called ""Players""
    local TeleportService = game:GetService(""TeleportService"") -- Defines ""TeleportService"" as the Service that will allow us to teleport between places
    local PlaceID = 12345 -- Defines ""PlaceID"" as the ID of the place we will teleport to

    local function onBrickTouch(touch) -- Creates a function called ""onBrickTouch"" with a parameter of ""touch"" so we can pass data into it

        local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(touch.Parent) -- Defines ""player"" as the Player who touched the brick

        if player -- If it was a player that touched the brick...
            then TeleportService:Teleport(PlaceID,player) -- Then teleport them to the place
        end -- Ends the ""if then"" statement
    end -- Ends the function
    script.Parent.Touched:Connect(onBrickTouch) -- Runs the function when something touches the brick

```

As a quick summary of the script, we defined some variables to make it easier to tell the script what we need to use/get in order to achieve what we want. From there, we created a function that will check if it was a player that touched the part, and if it was, then it will teleport them to the second place. This function was activated by the event on the last line (outside of the function) that is waiting until something touches script.Parent (which is the brick, so long as you put the script directly inside of the part).

In order to get the ID of the second place, go back to that ""Places"" folder, right click the second one, then click ""Copy ID to Clipboard"". This will get the PlaceID that is normally in the web address bar of each place. Change what I put as ""12345"" for what you got when you copy pasted that place's ID. To edit the second place, simply doubleclick its icon in that folder and it'll open up that place in another Studio application.

This should be about all you need in order to achieve what you were wondering! I believe if someone looks at your profile while you are in the secondary place, it will show that you are in the main one, still. If you wanted to barr/prevent specific players from being able to use that teleporter, here's what you can add to the script on line 9:

```
    if player and player.UserId ~= ID of the user
```

All this will do is, in addition to checking if they are a player, also making sure that they do not have that user ID.

If you have any further questions, please let me know (especially since it's super early in the morning so I probably missed something)! Hope this will work for you :D",ftgin4p,ftggrtp

My son, who is 8 years old, loves Roblox. But tonight, something happened that made him quite upset. And since I know next to nothing about this game, I need some advice. He said he was playing a game called ""Escape McDonalds Obby Parkour"", and when he was about to jump, he said something popped up that caused him to purchase a ""unicorn thing"" (his words) using his robux, which he didn't want but apparently the button for jump is the same button to purchase, so it took 649 robux from his balance and when he exited the game, he no longer had this ""thing"" he purchased.

He was quite upset because he accidentally bought something he didn't want and now doesn't have. Is what he is telling me accurate? Can this happen? Is there anything he (or I) can do to correct what seems to be a mistake, a bug - or worse, an intentional trick to get robux (which equate to real $) from a child.

Roblox support said to contact the game developer, but they wouldn't be able to refund the robux, so I'm not sure what good that would do. I hope someone can explain this to me, because as a non-Roblox player and concerned parent, this all seems a little shady.",g527yqj,N/A

So my account ""wolf2301"" out of the blue has its e-mail swapped with no e-mail prompt, no password change e-mail notice, no nothing. I go to log in one day as my brother wanted me to look at something and I'm greeted with a password incorrect prompt and we're confused.

I try a number of passwords I have and none of them worked, so I tried to reset the password and it asks for the e-mail, so I put in the e-mail that it was SUPPOSED to be tied to, and I get the e-mail with the link I'm supposed to click and I'm given FOUR accounts in a list telling me what are tied to the e-mail and which one I wanted to change. 3 of which, I've NEVER seen before, and the 4th one WAS MY BROTHER'S account. And he doesn't even have access to my e-mail.


He wasn't given a prompt on his e-mail being swapped, his account was just tied to my e-mail all of a sudden. I ask him to check his e-mail to see if my account was tied to his and nothin'. That means MY account is just out there floating around tied to whatever e-mail its tied to now.


I have tried Roblox support, TWICE now. and both times without fail, giving me what seems like an automated response telling me to put the digits of the first game card I had ever redeemed on that account like I was supposed to know from years ago to keep that first card for something like this. I tried on the e-mail account that it the account used to be tied too, and the e-mail we signed up to Roblox with initially, and both times they asked me for the game card. 

Do they even read the messages that you're supposed to write to describe the problem? I explained it to them and on the second try with support, I even outright SAID that we don't have the game card anymore. What am I supposed to do at this point? Any other time I would just drop it, but because I've spent money on it, I can't. (I was gonna put Two-Step Verification on the account too, but I didn't get the chance as my phone is new and the account was apparently gone already by then.)

1: I will not alter my expectations of ROBLOX as a platform when they are taking a MASSIVE percentage of my profits as a game developer.

If it isn't their responsibility to prevent cheating on their platform, why aren't they providing us with the tools necessary to implement custom launchers with anti cheats built in. The game does not have to be 100% cheater proof, but it should be secured well enough that most 9 year olds with their parents' credit card can't just download synapse and wreck havoc on the platform as is currently the case.

2: I mentioned this earlier in my post, but in case you missed it I am a career cybersecurity professional and I think that gives my statements some level of veracity.

This isn't only about the end user and how many times they can click generate, we have to go after the people behind the mass amounts of alternate accounts being generated, and this is the way to do it.

How old does the IP have to be before it's considered part of an account vs a hacker? What if a hacker were to get into my account and I didn't notice I was missing items until a week later? I could contact support and get my items restored, then the hacker can come in later and still use the same supposed social engineering tactics to get into my account, and the request was made from a previous IP.

And again, what about mobile users who may have changing IPs every time they change data cell towers? Or parents who contact on behalf of the child from a different location? Again, making it a steadfast rule would create a lot of problems for the already overworked support team. Imagine trying to explain to thousands of parents about IP addresses and why they can't recover the account. I actually think the ""vast majority"" of Roblox users are  mobile users who may run into this issue fairly often. Hell, nearly half of the people browsing /r/Roblox are mobile users.

For IP bans, isn't it still another issue of ""Roblox making developers do the work"" if developers still need to detect, verify, and ban exploiters? It's fine if it's another tool to use, but it would still come down to the individual developers to implement in their own way. If you say that developer-made anti-exploit becomes ""outdated"" quickly, then IP bans will not solve this.

Still, is support team social engineering really the #1 problem? Most users lose their account due to basic social engineering of ""free robux"" or whatever. Time could be much better spent on working on methods that do not interfere with the user, such as educating users more thouroughly, or requiring users to complete a special game before being able to chat (I doubt most bot networks will dedicate the resources to run thousands of instances of Roblox to complete a game, just to be able to chat)

&#x200B;

Claiming still that ""Roblox is doing nothing"" is incredibly naive. Do you really think they're just sitting on their asses? Do you think they go ""Man, people hate this"" and don't think ""This is cutting into our bottom line""  


They know. They're working on it. But again, there are *so many* reasons why it's not as simple as ""just secure it."" I previously mentioned how Roblox doesn't work on Linux because of anti-cheat. Imagine if Roblox implemented more anti-cheat that stopped certain Android models from connecting. Or caused 5% more CPU usage with a userbase who usually gets hand-me-down computers or cheap mobile phones. Or the privacy issues about anti-cheat that can detect other programs running on a CHILD'S computer just to try to stop cheats. (Can you imagine the fallout if Roblox keeps track of what other programs a child has installed on their computer, if they're running it while playing Roblox, and Roblox saving this information? Many other anti-cheats do this, but usually for M rated games where users under 13 do not or can not play.) Or adding something that breaks a lot of games, like FE originally did ages ago. Just like with IP addresses, there is always a lot of ""What if's"" with anti-cheat and the potential for false flags.

So far you're proposing grand ideas, but seem to have no idea the specifics of the engine or development, or anticipating problems early to try to figure out what could go wrong and fix it. I can almost guarantee that someone at Roblox said the same things, and another developer stepped in with ""That's a good idea in theory, but in practice it'll have issues with X or Y or Z, so it isn't entirely viable."" Or worse yet, someone proposing an idea and it's shot down with ""We tried that already"" or ""That'll work but it's easily worked around, so we shouldn't spend our time on it.""",glibm09,gli2yas

Being that it's on a tablet I find it more difficult to control the roblox person and would like for my kids and myself to be able to play it on the tv with a controller. I currently only have a nvidia sheild tv which apparently doesnt support roblox because I've managed to sideload it on there but none of the controls work on the game pad. Is there another option for playing it on the big screen with a controller with having to buy an xbox or other console?  I can't find a way to cast from the tablet if that's possible and even if it is I do not see how I could make the game controller work with it.",f75vhau,N/A

He never created a separate account on the Roblox website. His user name is my husband's iTunes username but there's no password or email address connected to the Roblox account. Not realizing this, I bought him a Roblox gift card. Because there's no password, we can't log into the website to redeem them. Because there's no email address connected to the account, we can't reset the password.

Any ideas on how I can redeem the gift card on his Roblox account, or am I just out that money?",fb50i7t,N/A

I'm trying to create a main menu GUI for my game. So far, the main menu itself will open and close and is all set up in that respect.

What I'd like to do is have it so pressing one of the TextButtons within my main menu GUI will then open another GUI. For example, pressing on the 'How To Play' button will consequently open the tutorial GUI and close the main menu GUI.

I wouldn't be surprised if it's simple, but coding has never been my strong point, and googling it has turned up nothing.

If someone has a script for how to do that, I'd greatly appreciate being shown it!

Thanks for any help!
