How do I punish her?,invisablecat,2023-03-02,1677741737.0,5,"My 10yr old purchased a bunch of stuff on Roblox and Toca Boca. How do I punish her?
My daughter has changed the settings on her ipad to allow purchases.
I noticed it this morning and have since changed it and have a lot more restrictions on it.
She doesn't know (yet) that I know what she is doing. She knows stealing is wrong.
I have decided to remove both apps for at least a month. I would also like to give her a punishment that becomes a teachable lesson.
What can I do? Any suggestions?",N/A,N/A

Then you need to make sure that it isn't just punishment for punishment's sake.  My niece ran up like EUR 3,000 worth of charges on my BIL's credit card buying stuff on her phone. Luckily here there are really strong consumer protection laws and he got it all back but it took months.  The first part of her punishment was to simply have to sit down and have a very long talk about money with her dad:

- here's how much I earn, here is how much of that you spent, here is how much we spend each month on X, Y, Z.  So, you have to decide which things we cut.  Are we buying fewer groceries this month? Are we not putting gas in the car and walking everywhere?  Are we cancelling the weekend trip we had planned to the mountains? We hvae to cut 3k from the family budget this month and you have to decide what gets cut and then you have to tell mom and your siblings about your decision.

He didn't do much punishment beyond that because he said that he wanted her to learn from the situation not feel bad about it and second, that he viewed it as partly his fault as well for having her settings on her phone and their plan set up that she could just buy stuff willy-nilly without his approval.  Also given that so many apps and games are kind of predatory, he felt like he couldn't expect her to understand fully just how much she was spending when making these little micropurchases.",jaljx0h,N/A

That means 1) Screen Time on with a screen time password and the iPad set up as a child account to your family, 2) content restrictions on so no App Store or in app purchases, 3) Roblox parental controls on with a PIN and set to All Ages with no purchases or chat/comms. 4) Require password for purchases (and the kid does not know the password), and don’t turn on Touch ID. 5) App time limits set up, Safari shut down or restricted to an allow list. Few people do all this but it makes a giant difference. 

I’m not a fan of big punishments nor giving kids access to devices/apps/etc. without understanding their implications and boundaries. Have you tried playing Roblox as your kid? It’s full of a bunch of questionable games, and if you haven’t locked down chat, questionable people. Roblox is trying endlessly to get kids to purchase stuff. Can’t rely on these companies to keep kids remotely safe; they are motivated by making money and I think simply don’t care.",jalsobm,N/A

It lets you create virtual credit cards that you can use on these sites (roblox, etc) and you can set spending limits on the cards and even pause/unpause them at any time. So you could set a $10 limit/month on roblox, or have the Toca card paused until your child asks to make a purchase. 

It’s completely free to sign up for and to use; and no, I don’t get any sort of compensation for promoting this. I use it for much of my online spending (separate cards for each subscription like Netflix) and also cards for my daughter’s gaming accounts - roblox, Toca, etc. When she wants to buy something she lets me know, she gives me the money, I unpause the card and she buys it.

When we asked them what they thought was healthy, and actually read some articles together about child brain development and the effects of screen time on their learning etc, they began to understand we weren't being the tyrannical parents they thought we were. 

We have agreed with them that 1 hour a day is acceptable with nothing before school, after all jobs have been done and under the proviso that their attitude . Slowly we have been winding that back to be more like 1 hour 3 days a week, and then 2 hours on the weekend.

He's always gravitated towards video games though even before that. We struggled the first year of his obsessions (Covid remote-kindergarten made it so much worse ughhhh) with setting video game limits. But his tantrums over quitting and mood in general eventually got BAD. He was 6. so we had to take a long break. Like zero, zip, bass video games.

He took is surprisingly well. We talked a lot about mental health, neuro health, attention, etc. He's a very bright kid (kids who gravitate towards video games often are very bright!!) and with enough check ins, he started seeing how going without video games was helping. He said something like ""yeah I wake up and I don't feel like I HAVE to play anymore!""

After a couple of months we slowly introduced them back, setting a strict schedule. Allowed one hr 3 days of the week and set a timer. When timer went off he had 10-15 min to wrap up, and if he threw a fit, he would lose his next session.

My kiddo is now playing .....2 hrs on Tues and Thurs after school. And 1.5 hrs in AM and 1.5 hrs PM on weekend days unless something else is going on. This is usually instead of tv/movies. Me and his siblings will watch a movie and he plays video games for instance. 

With this strict schedule, and the tough year of work we did, he's in a good rhythm, no tantrums or yelling at us, etc. he'll on rare occasion even quit on his own when he gets tired even if he hasn't hit his time quota. 

One thing I've noticed is how video games are sooooo bonding for kids now days. Other kids his age all play Minecraft too so it really helps him relate w others. At recess that play make believe Minecraft. Also, he plays a mini game where he learns French ha. So also I like to remind myself that video games aren't bad, and I don't like using language that sounds judgey of the video game playing, treating it like ""junk"" or whatever. I don't want it to be seen as a ""guilty pleasure."" That all can actually promote dysfunctional patterns too. Like sneaking it, hiding it, playing in middle of the time etc. 

We also make it a habit to have him show us his characters, his builds, and watch him do some mini games. I guess I've kinda come to love Minecraft too now that I think about it lol. I've never touched the game myself but seeing the creativity and love for it in my son sparks some love of the game ha.",j0tuefh,N/A

I used to feel a lot of guilt that my kids had way too much screen game time.

They stop all screens for family dinner & eating. The older ones still seek out peer activities in real life. And all of them do one physical activity. 

So really, sure, Roblox is bad if my alternative was my kids reading book after book & experimenting with science in between solving math equations and learning language on duo lingo — but honestly, I don’t think that is realistic, so gaming it is!! 

My rule of thumb has been monitored gaming = OK. Social media posts = bad. So far this theory is working!",j0u7rin,N/A

An hour of Roblox means 2-3 hours or bike riding, reading, practicing drums, helping cook dinner, playing a board game, etc. It has worked really well for our house but that is ONLY because his screen time isn’t “problematic” to me: I monitor the content, make sure he is only playing with kids we know from school, and talk explicitly  with him about how to identify dangerous content (including content that might be violent, racist, misogynistic, pretending to be science, etc.). 

I also try to prioritize “useful” screen time; when he builds something cool in Minecraft, I listen to him walk me thru how he did it. If he find a cool trick in some game, I ask him to show me how he figured it out. Lots of his preferred YouTube content is science creators, or nature creators, or people who do woodworking or other hands on stuff. A few years ago I sent him to a coding summer camp; this summer he’s going to a “creator camp” that is for engineering stuff that’s kid appropriate. It makes me feel like I am doing my best to link all that screen time into some real world stuff to keep it balanced

I know it’s winter right now but think about investing in a bike (and a bike rack so he can bike different places) or a basketball hoop. Take him to the library every week and look for fun graphic novels or comic books that might hold his attention.

 We have 1 kid together, who is 5, and I have 2 11 year old twin step kids. They each have their own tablet, which are just cheap Amazon fire tablets. The child settings are absolutely atrocious…. When those are on, the tablets seemed to be nothing more than simple leap pads which we were trying to get them away from. So I looked into how to block certain things without restricting the tablets to the Nth degree.       
      
So my wife turned on the settings on the Amazon account to require passcode for purchases. I restricted the google play store, YouTube, silk browser, and a few other misc apps/domains. Plus, their Wi-Fi profile is on a timer, so their tablets turn on every day from 7-9:30, but due to chores and bathing and such, they’re typically getting about 45 mins to an hour of screen time before bed.    
    
We also don’t pay for anything ourselves on the games or tablets. If they want more gems/lives/money, whatever, they need to provide the cash to us to buy. BUT, they have to prove to us that they have put money in their “savings jar,” before they can buy anything.  Games need an update? No problem. Pop on my hotspot, connect their tablets, update games, and put them back on the house network.           
      
They don’t argue, they don’t complain or whine, it just is what it is and it’s been that way a few years. They know that the amount of screen time they get depends on their own efficiencies.",j0u5h8g,N/A

Loved all the different games and the fact I could interact with people. Let me tell you, after reading some of these comments and a little re-examining of my youth, that was not a healthy place to be. Even that long ago I remember some pretty sketchy game modes and interactions. I’ve struggled with a gaming addiction as long as I can remember and it wasn’t a “struggle” at first. At first it was awesome. I’ve played Halo, Zelda, Civilization, StarCraft, League, Diablo, WW, Skyrim, Warframe, COD, and so on for easily a hundred thousand hours. Don’t even get me started on the money. My parents should have limited me (how the hell was I gonna know) but instead I spent more time in games than I did in waking life. That drives you to want to be in those worlds instead of this one. That sacrifice is comforting and easy to make when there is so much beauty, entertainment, and satisfaction from the games. This leads to a major disconnect and subsequent struggle with depression. I could have learned how to play guitar or draw better, could have read some books, planned a business, made some friends.

Also, they sued a youtuber for several thousand dollars and banned him from ever getting on the game again since they called out Roblox’s bad mods. Anyways, let’s go a bit deeper:

Remember the Crosswoods incident? Roblox mods knew that sort of thing was possible since 2016 but didn’t do anything about it. They also removed Tix, which was essentially a system where you got some Tix every time someone joined your game, then you could cash it in for small amounts of Robux. They removed OOF, an iconic sound. On the topic of sounds, they also removed nearly all of them for some stupid reason. They removed Guests, which were a free-trial account. They ban people for no reason, yet let the scammers and stalkers stay. Reporting people does nothing at all. They let images of porn exist without censoring or removing them. There’s more, but you get the point.

Roblox has got your kid's attention now, and what you need to do is find something else to do that gets his attention. 

If you ban videogames he'd just find a way around it. You need to replace videogames with another activity.

Another mom said her daughter ended up in sex rooms w/ the characters having Roblox orgies. Some other guy paid young girls in Robux to record themselves & send him the videos. Once I learned all of this, I was like nope! There are too many predators on Roblox.

I think video games & electronics, in general, can become addictive for kids.. not to mention some of the kids playing online are super toxic & say inappropriate things because they have no adult involvement. It's pretty obvious that some of them are just allowed to sit on their games all day & have unrestricted internet access & their parents pay no attention to them... which is why I set rules for my kid & enforce them. He now mostly plays Minecraft & Rocket League. I do let him play COD sometimes because I'm okay with w/ military-style violence (vs GTA for example... fighting for your country? Cool. Hijacking a car? Not cool.)

But all of his devices are now linked to a parental control service, which not only filters content but also alerts me when any content or messages contain certain themes/topics or words & I also set time limits. Once his time is up, that's it for the day. I don't allow him to play first thing in the morning or before he's done with schoolwork & he isn't allowed to play within an hour of bedtime. At random, when I feel he needs to detox, I have ""no electronics"" days where he's not allowed on anything at all & has to read or play outside or play w/ his non-electronic games/toys. I make sure I balance the electronics w/ reading & sports & family time. Before I did all of this, he was acting like an addict.

my advice to any parent with really  young kids is be extremly selective with what games you let your kids play, these never ending, always rewarding modern games are as the OP says like crack.",j0tqz4y,N/A

Video game addiction in kids is a legitimate concern. Here's what the Mayo Clinic website says about it:

[https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-video-games-and-screens-another-addiction](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-video-games-and-screens-another-addiction)

""Consider these tips:  
Follow guidelines for screen time, such as those suggested by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  
Model healthy use of screens and video games. Consider unplugging when you first get home from work, at dinner and when driving. Model other methods of relaxation and entertainment, such as taking a walk, playing a game, having a dance party or reading a book.  
Encourage a balance between screen time and activities that require in-person social interactions, such as family activities or extracurricular activities.  
Create structured, screen-free times, such as during mealtimes, in the mornings and before bedtime.  
Consider using apps that control the length of time your child can use a device.  
Keep screens out of bedrooms.  
Require that all devices be charged outside of bedrooms at night.  
Learn about the game rating categories and only allow your children to play video games suitable for their ages.""",j0x713w,N/A

YouTube and YouTube kids are designed to be addictive, especially YouTube kids. It does something way different to my child than a normal kid show that is meant to be educational. It’s not per se about being an addictive personality, there is something far deeper going on with these kinds of sites and games. My husband loves to play video games, and we are getting our daughter into them as well for the problem solving aspects. But, I don’t think we will let Roblox into our home, and we are extremely selective with what our children are allowed on devices and tv. They are pushed to the more educational shows and sometimes also the fun ones but those are also being observed to make sure they are not inappropriate. We don’t let them onto YouTube or YouTube kids at all in our home because we can’t control what is being presented to them, and the way the algorithms are designed is not healthy for kiddos. I can literally see the differences between the kiddos in our family who are allowed it and the ones who are not, it can be night and day. It’s also a lot easier to get my kids off a show from Netflix like True, than it is to get them off YouTube Kids, so we don’t allow it.",j0ugalx,j0szugj

My 5 year old gets about an hour and a half of TV/Games per day, but it's all through my sole TV in our den. We don't own tablets and they aren't allowed to use Mom or Dad's phone. 

My TV is basically just a large monitor for the computer that connects to it, so everything is done with a keyboard/mouse or games are played with a proper controller. If the 5 year old wants to do something on there, he somewhat understands how to use the mouse to ""continue playing"" in Netflix, but not much else. 

Basically, if he wants to watch or play something different, he needs parental help to do it. No just mindlessly tapping on this or that or being able to click the YouTube icon. Sometimes he does lose his shit, but more often than not, he's content to put down whatever he's doing at the end of his time. Further, often if he chooses something and he doesn't like it, if no one wants to help him change it, he'll lose interest and just go play with his toys instead. 

Feels a little more like how I grew up, with minimal instant gratification and with not a huge amount of control over changing stuff constantly for that dopamine hit. Not to mention, I've been gaming since the 80s, so he doesn't get exposed to stuff with microtransactions or generally just exploitative games in general. 

Feels like I've had less trouble with him than my sister in law did with my nephew at the same age, who had/has a tablet. But, that could also just be a difference in kid, who knows?",j0uqn0h,j0szugj

Roblox is a platform that developers make games for and many of the games have plots (like the Piggy series) while many others do not (Doors). I think what makes it so addicting is the fact that is has SO many games to choose from so after the kid is over one of them, there are millions more to try/play. It’s like buying a console and instantly having access to every title. Throw in the fact that you can play it with your friends and it’s no wonder we can’t peel our kids away. 

My son is 10 and I’d say it was his go-to game during COVID only because it’s free so he and his friends would get on a Google meet call and play. Minecraft on the other hand has an upfront cost so not all of friends could play, ya know?",j0tap88,j0sugv1

It creates a little extra work for us as parents to help navigate, which is fine - that’s our job.  We’re clear on the rules and we were especially empathetic and patient when they were little and learning the rules around gaming time limits (and everything else).

I'm a well-adjusted adult, and I think that has more to do with not having a smartphone/tablet with 24/7 access. 

I work with kids and the ones that worry me are on YouTube for 7 hours during school hours. They physically cannot turn it off without me ripping it out of their hands. The ones who work hard at school, use their device responsibly, then finish their homework and chores *before* playing video games for hours...they'll be alright imo.

I asked her to just take a small break and told her it's not good for her brain and she reluctantly listened but had a huge attitude all day and kept asking to watch the phone again. 

There are no regulations for that stuff. I let her watch TV all day if she wants because she doesn't just sit and watch it. She plays with her toys and she will go outside and play or Play dress up and draw. It's all pbs and some things on Netflix that she's watching and she's happy and learning.

My suggestion about adding things isn’t because I think sports are better than video games.

My toddler often wants me to sit in the floor with him and watch him line up his cars; usually I for an hour or so, but I need to put on some music so I can actually tolerate it for that long. 

And honestly, TV doesn't seem to be so bad. Early in the pandemic, my oldest was about 2 and a half and we sat and watched TV a lot of days. Now they're 5 and very smart, motivated and kind, in spite of having hours of TV a day been in 2020 and early 2021. 

But I feel the guilt. I'm actually sick today and having trouble engaging with my toddler. Normally we'd be out doing stuff, but there's nothing more I want to do then stick them in front of the TV so I can just rest, but I feel completely guilty even at the thought of it, so I haven't yet.

Edit: I do want to say, I 100% agree about the actual TV and not a phone or tablet. They can move around, play with toys, get up and wander around and not just sit like a zombie with the tablet 5 inches from their face. Exactly why we only have the TV.",j0uu0iu,j0usx3t

They get that, and don’t tend to have addictive personalities, so I don’t have any issues with her playing.  She’ll sometimes go months without playing and then start playing again with her friends.",j0u8a13,j0u4so0

What a cop out for enabling addictive behavior in your *seven year old*.

>They are given laptops for school and eventually will have a cellphone in high school

And until she's legally 18, she does not get final say on what is, and isn't, installed and allowed to be used on those devices. You're *choosing* to abdicate your own responsibility here on the basis that ""can't ban her from devices forever""...despite the fact that I *never* suggested banning her from all electronics in the first place.

>It’s like candy, most kids LOVE candy and ask for it but it doesn’t mean we give it to them all of the time.

I'm sorry, but there's a HUGE difference between a kid who asks for candy but accepts being told no...and a kid who is *watching the level of their parents' coffee cup anxiously* because they know they get their fix when mommy's coffee is gone.

Giving her something else to do when you take the games away (if you do, and with whatever the ""addiction"" your taking away is) helps a lot. She probably won't want it at first but eventually it'll help. 

If she has an additive personality, it'll be lifelong. Some steer it towards something productive. But games and tiktok are such quick dopamine highs that it's hard without them being aware and understanding. So educating her on it as she grows will also help. 

Wish you luck. Addictions are tough, especially in kids. Helping her get a grip now though will save her a ton of trouble later.",j0tdwt8,j0t1ri0

Basically, I am at a loss and would love some experienced parents insight and suggestions. I don't really have anyone to ask. 

Background: Due to some unfortunate circumstances my 13 year old niece is now under my care full time. I am very new to all of this. 

A couple months ago I noticed some strangers pop up on her Facebook messenger app and asked her about it. She admitted to not knowing these people IRL and that she just randomly added them on Facebook. We had great discussions about Internet safety, removed everyone she didn't personally know and I had high hopes we were all good. We weren't. 

The next incident occurred about a month later on a Snapchat account I didn't even know she had. She would apparently download the app to use and then delete it so I wouldn't see it. Well, one morning I guess she forgot to delete the app and I noticed a Snapchat notification on her phone. So, I opened it up. She once again randomly added a TON of people (like 50-60) who she would talk and send pictures to at all hours of the night.  Normally, Snapchat doesn't save your messages unless you specifically set it to, which she and the creeps she was speaking with had.
The chats and photos I had the absolute horror of discovering were unbelievably explicit. The absolute worse you can imagine, believe me. There was so much. It was all she used the app for.

Obviously, I freaked out. I grounded her from her devices, explained how dangerous and inappropriate what she is doing was, had a bit a melt down myself afterwards and life went on.

A few weeks later, I see a notification on my own Facebook that my niece had joined a group. Odd, as she has no device so I checked into it. Using her school computer (she has an IEP allowing her a personal laptop at school to do her work), she had joined a Facebook group for adults to specifically speak explicitly with one another. So, another talk, more privileges taken for a period of time. 

Eventually she gets her phone back with limited access and periodic check ins to see what she's up to. She's behaving, schools going good, no issues on the phone so I get a bit lax, allowed her messenger again for people she knows with checkups and Roblox. 

This leads up to last nights incident. 

Since getting Roblox back, she has been sneaking her phone at night and set up a Pinterest account (in the browser as she can't download apps) and has been continuing to contact people by telling them to add her on there and using the chat feature. PINTEREST. I didn't even know there was a chat function. 

One final detail that I am reluctant to even put into words. All of it, from the very beginning was very intense sexting surrounding a ""DD/LG"" relationship. Like, very specifically always this. The Facebook group she joined was for one to find the other. I don't know if this means anything. 

Am I reading into this too much? It's like she will do anything to talk to these creeps in this way. Like go to any length to be able to do this. I can't give her a phone to contact me or anyone else or vice versa because it's like she will always find a way. There's no way this is acceptable, right? This is not normal preteen-teenage behavior, right?",N/A,N/A

She was catfishing adults, on top of having been groomed. All of this came from people she met in forrnite. Since taking that all away she is much happier.

It’s very common when children have been exposed in one way to sexual contact/material, that they then seek out that same type of contact/conversation. This is absolutely not her fault. She’s been exposed (somehow) to this world and it’s very hard to reverse that interest now, without some professional intervention. If you haven’t already, try and establish if any of these people appear to be adults then call the police. Most likely, they are adult sexual predators, or at least some amongst them. They need reporting because they will likely be doing this with other children. Police will now even work with police in other countries to catch these people. 

Your niece is very much a victim and should not be shamed or punished. But you do need to set clear boundaries and expectations of her and remove all devices (school need to be aware and on board too)

I’m not an expert in monitoring devices but believe, when the time comes to give her phone etc back, that you can ‘clone’ her phone in a sense, so you can see in real time what she’s doing. Ask your school for support around this as they should know a service to refer you to to help with this

I suspect that she has been exposed to this by an adult before any of this began. One doesn’t start messaging people about explicit and BDSM topics without knowing about it first. 

I haven’t dealt with this myself, but the first thing that needs to go is the smartphone. If she really needs to contact you, she can have a flip phone without internet access. See if you can put restrictions on the computer she uses at school and make sure she only has access to that computer for school purposes. There may be a way for you to block certain websites like social media so she can still use the internet for other things on there if she needs to.

I think this might also warrant some therapy. Why is she having these urges to talk to so many people this way? What sparked all of this? There are also other problematic behaviors like sneaking around that need to be addressed before they get even worse.

I did almost the exact same thing as your daughter when I was 16, except I used Kik. My dad got the police involved and the detective in charge of my case talked to me about the dangers of what I was doing. It was everything my dad had tried to tell me of course, but coming from a detective it sunk in much more deeply. This might be something to consider for your niece. 

And as others have commented - definitely get her in therapy. 

I would also take her phone and get her a track phone (one of the old flip phone types) that way she can still contact people but won't have access to the apps. If you're in the U.S. they have them at Walmart. Also, I would take away any computer/tablet access. She has proven it's not safe for her to have access to them.

You’re doing a lot, learning a lot, handling a lot and experiencing a lot all at once. Take a second to breathe. Now understand your niece is going through a lot too. We don’t know the circumstances from which she was removed from her home and in your care. But this behavior is not typical and she is in need of some serious therapy and quick. I would call the pediatrician and the insurance and start calling. The pediatrician can help get things moving with a referral and sometimes get a child into a therapist office fast when needed. 


Second, no phone or internet privileges. This is to keep her safe. I understand you need to get a hold of her and you have options there are parental safety phones and apps and flip phones. If she has an iPhone there’s a parental option that she needs permission to download anything. I would seriously consider a phone with no internet access. As far as her school computer there should be precautions in place to prevent kids from accessing social media—I would tell the school of this incident. 


Third. She’s 13 and she does not need social media, including Pinterest. Look up what social media does and decide for yourself. The correlation between mental illnesses in teens and social media is real. There are law suits right now about this. But do your own research and come to a conclusion. 


Fourth. Clearly she doesn’t understand internet danger. I’d contact your case worker and see if they have advice on moving forward and also to document this. This also sounds like it warrants a police report. These strangers are in possession of her explicit photos (minor) and have been communicating explicitly with a minor. 


Lastly, get yourself some help with going through this. This is going to a long road of helping your niece. Take care and good luck. One day at a time.",jarmp2o,N/A

This is so scary. 

Not as in you have to allow it, definitely don’t. But she is doing this because she is getting something out of that kind of relationship or these interactions. I think it’s important for her to see a therapist and I think it’s important for you to see a therapist maybe about handling the issue. This is important because she is getting something from this relationship or these chats. If it’s validation, you need to involve her in ways that she is getting validation in other ways. Either from you or friends. If it’s compliments to feel loved, sports. She needs something to fill her time and perhaps involve her in sports or a drama club or art club? Something she is accountable to going to and perhaps you ensure she stays there. Stay. The down time is dangerous for her. Change all of the passwords, do not let her have the Wi-Fi password. 

Also be honest, I’m assuming the child is now in your care because she was either abused or her parents died. This hypersexualization is a glaring symptom of possible sexual abuse. 

It’s also important for you to go over with her WHY this is dangerous and how she will get hurt. Kids are smart, if she wants to get on the internet, she WILL find a way. 

I know when I was a kid, lifetime movies did a whole lot of scaring me to not do dangerous things. They were kind of graphic and maybe exaggerated, but it happens to people.

Put better parental controls on your home internet. And contact the school and let them know that these sites have been accessed using their servers. Most schools don’t allow access to Facebook or other social media. They will need to tighten up their procedures too. 

The best thing you can do is hold your boundaries with her and continue to be there for her. Allow her to ask questions, no matter how awkward. Make sure you’re a safe space for her when she feels unsafe or overwhelmed.

Only after growing up into my 20s did I ever feel that what I did was wrong and dangerous.

I was in her shoes. I did not have a happy home. I was the adult in the house and had to be the parent for everyone. Now I'm immature as fuck because I had not allowed the space to be a kid and continuously searched for this in those chats with bunch of old creeps. 

They do give you validation, 'love', etc - but all for the sake of grooming. 

I wish I had someone telling me to backoff. To stay off the internet. To interfere. All I got from my foster mum was ""Make sure they send money! We need it!"" But she'd never do anything to fix the problem. 

Anyways, I second what you said. She's doing these things because she wants something. Best to take the internet off. Talk to her. Tell her how she'd feel once she's older (disgusted & disgusted from sex, doesn't see sex as a normal thing but a disgusting activity.) 

Good luck.

Edit: Not saying she would feel about sex like how I do but it's disgusting for me simply because growing up with the only validation through your sexual nature is fucked up.

My 5 y.o. already ran into perverts. Luckily she can't read yet so she cannot see what they are saying. I scare the perverts when I catch them trying to do something. Then i completely block them and the servers so my daughter doesn't go in them again.

We let our 9 year old on it and she has done well with it. Although it’s becoming a bit addictive now so that’s a whole other issue. Our 8 year old really wants it, we let her try it and she saw a man running around with his head on fire and it gave her nightmares for a week so that’s a hard no for awhile.

That being said, roblox isn’t exactly the safest game out there for even older kids given how few preventative measures there actually are for them.

So we had to stop them from playing roblox. After a few months they wanted it back. So we let them go back to roblox under new rules and only in selected games and we used that to educate them.

It's basically a platform for people to create their own games so people can do whatever they want on it. 

We have a rule that my kids are only allowed to play games I've checked first (usually I skim through YouTube videos of the game) and they are quick to come and tell me if they notice anything in the game that made them feel uncomfortable and then they tell their sibling to not play that game and they all stop (a lot of the ""story' games sound nice and then end up creepy at the end for example... we're also Christian and strict about certain things) so I feel like I can trust them. If I did not feel that way, they wouldn't be allowed to play. 

You can disable chat and I would definitely do that because people post some not nice stuff there sometimes.

I'd encourage you to spend time playing with your kiddo if you do allow it so you can get a sense of it, of what he's playing, etc.",ij9rmm4,N/A

There are addictive elements to games like that and some of the other big games these days that I think are just too potent for little kids. I don't deny the positive aspects of the building process and creative things, but there's too much questionable and predatory content. When they are older, and can reason, and can filter, I'm sure it will become a thing. For my part, because I don't let them do that, I try to provide a lot of real world possibilities that keep them busy. For instance, I got them a 3-D printer and they use it quite regularly. As anyone who is in that community will tell you, it presents some of the same problems in terms of adult content and things like that when they are searching for things to print. So we have had to have those discussions, and there are rules about their conduct. If they break them, there are consequences.

It sucks that online communities where people can openly communicate are not safe places for children. But they're not. And so my kids are not allowed in those areas.

Why don’t you want your daughter having the phone? MIL would be an absolute idiot to argue against any key points such as child being a victim of strangers pretending to be a child online, being persuaded to use your credit cards for in app purchases etc you know, the serious issues.

She will come out with things like “don’t be silly, granddaughter would never be so silly to do that” and then show her news examples of kids who have done things like that.

1. You can disable the phone line and turn the phone into basically an iPod. I’m team iNation but android does have significantly better parental controls. Regardless of the model of the phone your kid has, you can effectively turn it into a toy for her and remove the ability for her to call grandma or access the internet etc. Take out the SIM card, factory reset, parental controls, etc. This option renders MIL powerless and keeps your kid happy. 

2. You can return the phone to MIL. This will upset kiddo but also send a clear message to MIL about the boundary stomping. “My daughter is not allowed to spend time with people who give her gifts behind our back and encourage secrecy from us. [this establishes the scope of what you can control: you don’t control MIL, you control your daughter’s social circle]. Please do not give gifts to kid without checking with us first. Please do not encourage her to keep secrets from us. [this is clearly defining the boundary for MIL]. If we are unable trust you to respect us with this, we will be unable to trust you around our daughter. We will take a [insert time block here] break from spending time with you. [the last two sentences may or may not be necessary depending on how combative or explanatory you need to be with MIL]. THEN, when it happens, “We already discussed with you that my daughter is not allowed to spend time with people who give her gifts behind our back and encourage secrecy from us. We’ll try again in [# of months]. I’ll call on [date].” Block her number and enjoy the silence.   (For great information on setting and maintaining boundaries check our Nedra Tawwab Glover’s “Set Boundaries Find Peace”). 

3. You can keep the phone and power it off and leave it in the dark recesses of your closet or dresser. You can use it for outgoing calls only, like the other commenter suggested—block her number and unblock only when you are ready to let daughter talk to her. When MIL asks you can deflect. “It’s always getting lost in the kids messy room, battery is always dying,” Or be more direct: “Kid isn’t old enough to have it all the time, we’ll let her have it unsupervised when she is.” This is the most neutral response albeit with an upset kid.",j1vzis7,N/A

We have certain rules. If and when they are broken phones get taken. The big rule we have is to respond when contacted. (Except in school) if anyone’s left on read, ignored, or “forgotten” about without very good reason, phones get taken away and music and games go away.

(Only one of the kids really has a valid excuse. His school is in a dead zone, so when he leaves there sometimes he forgets to take his phone off airplane mode, bc he can use it until he gets home and then by that time he’s focused on homework.)",j1ufgct,N/A

Your feelings are your feelings. I’m not going to tell you they are invalid. However, without knowing more about your overall relationship with your MIL, it’s difficult to make a judgement about what kind of response makes sense. If you were to say that your MIL has a history of frequently crossing boundaries and overall disrespect, then that is one thing. If you were to say that she does that occasionally, that would be another. If this is her first time, then that is another.

So, you have to look at the situation in the totality. You and your wife together have the right to decide what devices your child has access to. I’m not going to comment on the reasonability of that, because again, there are too many variables to consider that I don’t know.

However, your preferences don’t necessarily make you MIL a boundary stomping ogre, like some people have suggested. I’m probably closer to your MIL’s age than yours. I know a lot of people in this age range who just aren’t aware of all the things you mentioned in the same way you are. Also, we come from a generation where you could call on a land line and if someone was home, they would usually answer. So, it’s been an adjustment to the new ways cell phones create a different paradigm.

I usually try to pull back my focus a bit and see what the message is that the person is trying to convey, even if they do so clumsily. Here, it seems like your MIL would like to have more contact with your daughter. Again, I don’t know the totality of your circumstances so it’s up to you to take all of that into consideration, but I’d be trying to see if that’s something that makes sense, and if there’s a way to go about it that is more in line with your preferences for your child’s safety, etc. Is it feasible to work out some other way to address the desire for more contact? I don’t know the answer to that, but it might be worth considering.",j1wkxjc,N/A

And if you're worried about her exposure to maybe a pedophile or what you consider inappropriate for her age I also have to wonder if you understand how Roblox works..... My brain went into a tailspin when you ended with the negative consequences the phone but I'm assuming not the tablet might have on her development.

 Did your grandma give you a cell phone for Christmas when you were six? Because without developmental delays I'm not quite sure how you didn't manage to see the consistent hypocrisy? You have not a pinky toe to stand on if you're trying to debate this stance with your wife. Can the reasons you consider the phone inappropriate also apply to the tablet?

In relation to the phone itself, my 8 yo has had a phone that we gave her at a similar age to yours. She barely used it but we did have many restrictions in place. 

That was an android. We’ve all recently gone over to apple and so I created her an Apple ID with her own DOB and have been able to restrict it to enable her to use it as safely as possible. Same with Android.

I say this because you can ensure the phone is secure as best you can but that’s only IF you want to. Taking it off her and away seems harsh if I’m honest. It’s not her fault your MIL has done this. If you’re happy for her to use it then make sure you put on all restrictions you can.

They live 5 hours away and visited for the bday party. They said they wanted to be able to FaceTime and talk/text directly with him, so he doesn't have to use my wife's phone. 

There was no discussion or warning beforehand, they surprised him and us.

 I talked with my wife after the fact, since I think 10 is too young for a full fledged cell phone, but my wife was okay with it. I am constantly hearing the phone chime all hours of the day, and the only people who have the number are his grandparents and uncles. He takes the phone to school so he can text them immediately when he gets out. 

Now he no longer plays with his tablet, which I had bought a new one a few months ago to gift for Christmas.",j1uykue,N/A

I know it's easy to give advice from the outside, so say this having dealt with the same person. When ours were younger we had a pretty strict no screen policy; VERY well known among the family. So for Xmas? Tablets for everyone (because it was grandma, not parents)! I don't recall the exact events of the day but they went back to grandma who was instructed to send them back. Sorry, this is a no go and you know it. I lost my mind and wife drew the line with her the next day. It definitely set the precedent that Xmas, and when she knew we weren't passive about it she suddenly was on our side. Hopefully the alternative seemed less attractive when she saw us pack up and leave her tricks behind.

To some degree, ideas are like viruses. You have to expose your kids to the harmful ones, like cell phones and MILs, in small doses, like vaccines, so they build up immunity.

I’m living with years of regret of not cutting off the contact earlier.  I encouraged a relationship with her because that’s the only mom my husband has.

Something you can do is lock the heck out of the phone. You can remove and block the internet access, block the App Store, and make it so she only has access to calls and texting. Her friends may start to get phones too and they can talk and call to play games together that way. 

I remember we had to get my younger brothers (6&8 at the time) their own phones because they would CONSTANTLY be using ours to call their cousins to play games like Minecraft and Roblox. Like to the point it became a problem and we couldn’t work or leave or anything. But we had to lock their phones down so they had to request to buy things, only had access to certain apps, and we removed the internet completely. And then their friends at school gave them their numbers or kids messenger contact info so they were able to play games with their friends after school. (This was also during the pandemic when most kids were online schooling so it was hard to play with friends and socialize anyways). 

I do thing that MIL completely overstepped though and definitely should have consulted you before hand and the way she did everything was completely unacceptable, so it’s ultimately up to you what to do with the phone. 

I know kids leave stuff places all the time, forget to charge their phones, and will hide them places when they’re dead so it’s really difficult to find them. Sometimes they even forget them outside on accident and if you don’t see it then a huge storm comes through, that phone is screwed. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to rescue my brothers phones from outside or we’ve lost them for a few days cause the battery died and we forgot to charge them. We have a mini van and the amount of small spaces those phones fall into is crazy. So many ways the phone can get lost or accidentally destroyed…..",j1vlll4,N/A

I'd say don't overreact, grandparents are not working with a full deck anymore. And your kid's relationship to their grandparents is important even if they do inappropriate stuff like this. But absolutely don't let them have it. Either it gets ""lost"", or you need to have an honest discussion with your kid about why the gift is inappropriate and how your MIL just doesn't understand that.

Maybe give the phone back to your mom.

Maybe let your Mom know if she pulls a stunt like that again, you'll be limiting your access to your child.

Maybe tell your Mom she's not allowed to give gifts or money directly to your child without clearing it with you and your wife. 

Maybe let your Mom know that she needs to apologize to your kid and wife. And she doesn't get to trash talk your wife for not answering her phone. If your Mom is overbearing, I can see why your wife doesn't answer her phone. 

So, no need to be pissed. Just set and enforce clear boundaries.",j2ezq6i,N/A

I've had this discussion with my father trying to buy one for my daughter(she's 10). I agree that there is too much access to the things we as parents don't want our children exposed to yet. I would agree to her having one at her age if she was in regular school... but seeing as she's home with me there is no need... I can understand that your MIL wants more contact with her grandchild and that wonderful but giving her a secret phone was the wrong way to go about it. Try adding Skype to your daughter's tablet they could video chat together and you can keep her limited to just talking with her grandma. I hope your wife stands by your side like my husband did.

On the one hand, there are risks that come with access to the internet. On the other hand, I am vehemently against stealing from children (and I recognize that view may be unpopular and that people may refuse to call it stealing). I think that your best option is to strike a deal with your daughter-- purchase it from her, and maybe include in the payment to her a phone designed for children with parental controls so that she can still communicate with her grandmother safely. Then you can keep your daughter safe without being the grinch stealing her Christmas gift!

Edit: Make sure you compensate her fairly for the phone. Do not cheat her!  She may not understand the value of the phone now, but a few years from now she will, and she will remember!!",j2jyep7,N/A

But the reason I did it was that his mother had left his father and him when he was 2yrs old and he finally got to where he would let her take him on the weekends. He came back twice and said she got mad at him and sat him on the road and drove away and came back after 15 minutes. He wasn’t allowed to go with her anymore but he did stay with his grandparents at times and I didn’t want to take a chance on her showing up and taking him to the store or ect: so I got him the phone and added it to my Verizon plan and added family locater in case it ever happened again. But me and his father could monitor his activities on our lines. But he didn’t have any Facebook accounts or anything like that. He only used it to call his dad and me and play games. It was dangerous at what she had done and didn’t understand that he could have been kidnapped or anything. He is 18 and is still on my account and I still have the family locater added to my plan, for a extra 10 bucks a month it’s worth it.

In an emergency, like an abduction or a natural disaster, a smartphone can even track a person's location.

I am of an age that I grew up before microwaves and most people my age were never interested, we said we didn't need them, but later after we had one for a few days we said we didn't know how we ever lived without them. Sometimes the usefulness of an item isn't obvious until you have a chance to experience it. 

That said, I understand that being overruled as a parent is extremely disrespectful and I think that is the real problem, not whether your daughter has a phone or not, because your mother-in-law is checking in with your family way too much and interfering on a level that is inappropriate and demeaning.",j67mewi,N/A

Anything that someone gives to you in secret, and tries to keep from mom and dad, is not a good gift to keep. 

Focusing on the fact that it was a secret, not the fact that it was a phone, might be helpful. Like, it's not (only) that I specifically don't want you to have a phone. Because grandma gave it to you in secret, she knew it was the wrong thing to do. And when someone makes a mistake, we try to fix it. This time, we will fix it by returning the phone. Next time, if you think someone is making a mistake by giving you a secret gift, you should bring it to one of your parents before you open it to play.",j1udliv,j1ty804

If it *really* was just about mom not picking up her phone, Grandma could've just spun up an Asterisk Docker and bought grandkid a [VoIP handset](https://www.voipsupply.com/voip-phones/cordless/wi-fi/cisco-ip-phone-cp-8861-with-5-lines-and-open-sip)


That would've been way cooler than talking to [Grover, Ernie, or Oscar the Grouch](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/big-bird-phone--464363411548126777/)


Imagine the joy for a 6 year old being able to press 1 to call Mommy, 2 for Daddy, 3 for Grandma all on toll free SIP connections any time!!  If Grandma was on the ball, she could add Music-on-Hold lines with different music for grandkid.  Dial 4 for Today's Top 40, 5 for Christmas Hits, and 7 for EDM Classics featuring Avicii.

There really was a much better way for Grandma to handle this if all she wanted to do was talk to her grandchild.

You and your wife need to package it up and send it return receipt (for proof that it was sent back) to MIL.

I wouldn't pretend the phone got lost; I would put my foot down. Pussyfooting around the issue won't solve anything. Grandma needs to be clearly told what the boundary is, so she knows what will happen if/when she oversteps it in the future. 


""MIL, you giving (child's name) a phone without discussing it with us first was a gross overstep. (Child's name) is only six-years-old and an uncontrolled phone is a dangerous and inappropriate gift for a child of that age. We will be taking the phone back from (child's name) and explaining to her why it isn't okay/ safe for her to keep it. The phone will be locked away until (child's name) is at an age where we, as her parents, decide it is appropriate for her to have it.* If you wish to reach (child's name), you have only to text (wife's name) or I to set up a time so we can be sure to be available and answer your call.

To be fair... it's the kid's personal relationships. I wouldn't intervene unless red flags were there.

And perhaps you could say that if anything goes wrong, they're free to tell you, and you could help them.

(Kiddo has ADHD and we needed the help in learning how to help her).

That professional let her pick up something on the playground another child had left behind and told her that she could keep it if it she kept it a secret where she got it.

Kiddo was a bright 4 year old, but she didn't understand why she was supposed to keep it a secret (professional said she didn't want the other kids to be jealous) so when next we saw her, she said the stranger gave her the toy and told her to keep it a secret.

At 4 she knew she needed to tell as soon as she could.  She forgot the not accepting toys from strangers (she considered the child care giver a stranger, and remembered to tell, but not to not accept the toy).

She knows when she is older we will teach what kinds of things are good secrets, but that at her age all secrets are bad to keep from parents.  Some of her friends have told her ""secrets"" and when she tries to relay them to us, we tell it's okay to not tell who has the secret if she is worried about telling.  So far it's been ""crushes"" and minor naughtyness.  She knows we won't tell anyone's parent unless someone is going to get hurt - we don't care if someone is getting extra snacks, or staying under the covers reading.  

When she starts to tell us about a ""crush"", we ask if both parts of the crush are both children of the same age, and if so, we tell her that we don't need to know unless one of them being in unkind to the other or if one of them is in a different grade.

I'm referring to getting phone numbers from random people online they got through a videogame like Roblox. 

My daughter was probably 8 or 9 (a little older) but they kept telling us they \*HAD\* to play Roblox ""with their friends"" at exactly 5 PM every day or they would throw a fit. I knew they played with their friends who live down the street so I didn't mind so much.  

Then she started acting really suspicious about hiding the screen anytime I walked by.  So after she was done with her 30 minute session I opened it back up and looked at the group chat log.  

Yep, not her friends down the street, but a bunch of internet drama with like 10 random people about how ""her boyfriend"" was teaming up with some other girls instead of her because we made her quit after 30 minutes. Not only that, but MY kid had proactively told this ""boy"" what city she lived in, what her parents did, how old she was, etc.  He supposedly lived in Pennsylvania, and she wanted him to come visit.  Holy crap this violates like every ""online safety"" rule that both her school and our family have reviewed repeatedly.

The iPad went away for a while, Roblox was deleted.  I debated logging on and having a little ""dad chat"" with this kid, but decided against it. That's when we finally decided to get serious about locking down the iPad with parental controls.",j1zcz4x,j1xtuav

You haven't done anything wrong in accepting the gift, you had no way of knowing that type of gift isn't allowed.  In the future, we would like it if you told us if any adult gives you a ""secret"" gift for your own safety, remember tricky people will try to give you things to make you feel bad when you tell them no.

I'd say so.

>I'm referring to getting phone numbers from random people online they got through a videogame like Roblox.

Well it certainly has its dangers, although if you ask a lot of your friends, I'd say a good few would admit to giving their phone number to random people online.

There are enough extroverted people out there who are willing to do this.

>My daughter was probably 8 or 9 (a little older) but they kept telling us they \*HAD\* to play Roblox ""with their friends"" at exactly 5 PM every day or they would throw a fit. I knew they played with their friends who live down the street so I didn't mind so much.  
Then she started acting really suspicious about hiding the screen anytime I walked by. So after she was done with her 30 minute session I opened it back up and looked at the group chat log.  
Yep, not her friends down the street, but a bunch of internet drama with like 10 random people about how ""her boyfriend"" was teaming up with some other girls instead of her because we made her quit after 30 minutes.

Damn... first boyfriend at 8/9, even if in quotation marks. That's pretty early. She'd probably have a good romantic life in the future.

However she should be taught on relationship safety, red flags etc. if she wants a boyfriend in the future.

>Not only that, but MY kid had proactively told this ""boy"" what city she lived in, what her parents did, how old she was, etc.

Honestly this isn't that identifying. Depending on how big a city is, a few million people can be in a city.

And really, many people online would happily disclose what city they lived in to someone they barely knew, especially if they want to make friends or start a relationship.

>He supposedly lived in Pennsylvania, and she wanted him to come visit. 

To the house would be pretty excessive, although I can see a few people willing to do this. Just think of how many people invite random people online home (more than you think).",j239u8i,j1zcz4x

Isn’t that great? But don’t tell mummy and daddy - it’s our secret! If mummy and daddy find out they would stop us being able to talk on the phone and that would be so sad!”)

Most kids would struggle to understand that Grandma’s secret phone or Uncle Gary’s secret touching time are a bad/harmful thing, because they are being told by a trusted adult that it is a good thing and keeping this a secret is helping their trusted adult and doing the right thing. It relies too much on a child’s ability to perceive and weight up the help / hurt implications of concepts they don’t even understand.

You’re right that keeping a secret for a friend is helping them avoid embarrassment, but there is a different between secret keeping and info dumping. We don’t need to each recount loudly at dinner about the poos we did on the toilet today, but that doesn’t mean it’s a secret. We can tell a trusted adult if we need to, but don’t need to shout it from the rooftops to strangers. The important aspect is that our kids feel like they CAN tell us anything, including being worried about a suicidal friend, even if somebody has insisted they keep it secret. The difference is that some things are *private* and we can choose who we trust to share them with, some things are a *surprise* and we can’t tell until a special moment, but things that are *secret* and we aren’t allowed to tell others ever are unhealthy.",j1w8kte,j1vf48x

I know how unhelpful that sounds, but there really is no way around it. At this age, you opened pandora's box by allowing her to start the game in the first place. You need very clear expectations and rules for how long and when she gets to play. Use timers. Enforce it. Maybe she earns the game for a positive action? Whatever works for you. Make sure you explain *why* videogames are limited (brain junk food, no time for school/sleep, no family connection, etc.).

Her brain is addicted to the stimulus and it is a novelty. It might take time to wean her off. So you could start reducing her play time gradually. If you try and cut her off cold turkey, it will likely just lead to power struggles and anger. She likes this and YOU allowed it, so now arbitrarily taking it away is going to feel very unfair and confusing. The ultimate goal is to achieve a predictable, mutually agreed outcome in which she can have her game. And once she sort of gets used to *not* having it constantly and starts finding other ways to fill her time, she might not ask for it as much.

FYI, you should monitor her activity closely in the game. My kids aren't into this one personally, but I have heard it is possible for creeps to interact with kids if they have public access. I don't know how it works because, as I said, this isn't a favorite in our house. But you should look into it.",irlk3yf,N/A

Maybe y’all can try a new recipe together or even do some menu planning (6 year olds can do a lot in the kitchen!) If she’s reading independently, build regular library trips into your schedule.

We had a new baby and it kept him occupied during the time. He enjoyed it but he began to spend all of his time doing exactly what your daughter is doing. And his behavior was suffering too. Just epic meltdowns, super moody and not himself. Because of meltdowns/tantrums, we took away the PlayStation and tablet for two weeks at a time. First few days were brutal but he started going back to the things he used to love. Drawing, independent play, going outside, etc. He obviously needed more direction and help finding the next task to do to keep him occupied, but I don’t regret it. Then when he would get his tablet and stuff back, he would play for awhile and then randomly get bored and do something else. 

Much like adults when you decide your indulging too much into something and you try and fill your time with other things, that one big thing starts to lose its hold over you.

This gets them about an hour- 90 mins a day for screens on weekdays depending on when we have supper.  weekends they have screen time before I get up in the morning then not again until after supper so probably 2-3 hours on the weekend. I find because it’s our routine they don’t really fight me on it as they know when there will be time for screens.

Hi everyone, I'm wanted to ask advice on the following:

My daughter likes video editing and has been running a YouTube channel focused on Roblox/Minecraft etc. fanfiction content. Recently, her channel has grown to the point where she has over 6,000 subscribers, and some of her videos have over 6 million views. This means that if I were to monetize her channel, she could potentially earn a significant amount of money.

I'm proud of my daughter for her effort and dedication to her channel, but I'm also unsure about how to handle the financial aspect of this. My current plan is to open a bank account in her name, which she will gain access to when she turns 18. However, I want to make sure this is the best approach or if there are other considerations that I should be thinking about. With her best interest in mind I'm thinking about a wide range of topics from her wellbeing to the practical side like:

* not monetizing at all because I dont want just the money to be a driving factor. I want her to do things she love and not only think about money
* but then again, she loves making/editing these videos so it would be quite the accomplishment for her to get paid for it.
* collegemoney
* just let it sit in an account,
* investing the money

I try to teach my daughter to be independent and to let her make as much of her own decisions as possible so i would like to include her in the process of deciding on how to handle it. As of now she knows that she has a lot of subscribers and lots of views but since she never uses money because, well she's 9 and doesn't need money, she got no clue that A: this can make her serious money, or B: what serious money even is.

So my question is, what advice do you have for me as a parent in this situation? How should I handle this situation? How would you handle this? Any suggestions or feedback would be greatly appreciated.",N/A,N/A

Personally, I’d suggest monetizing it, but be very careful. Is she anonymous? If so, take steps to improve anonymity (never mention name, location, school, city, etc, ensure her account is not easily traceable, etc). If not anonymous, it’s not a deal breaker but be careful. Even more important is mentally. This is probably something that is short term, will stop making money in 6 months or a year. It is extremely important for you to embrace that and not push her to continue it or blame her once the viewers and money falls off. Let her keep being a child. Financially - set up a 529 account (at Fidelity or similar). The account is in your name with her as beneficiary. She can spend it on college- tuition, room and board, computers. Also trade school, private school. It can also be used to fund her Roth IRA up to 35k. Invest in a target date fund for the year she turns 20 inside the Roth IRA.

I think if she’s really good at it and is getting a lot of views/followers it would be worth monetizing and saving that money for her since life is expensive and only getting more expensive. Honestly not sure how you’d go about it in the future if she knew she was making a ton of money and wanted to start using it so that’s something to consider. Either way that’s awesome and congrats to her! She deserves to be paid and her talents could really get her somewhere.,jacq57h,N/A

Monetize it but don't let your child know that you are doing so at this time. She doesn't need to know at 9 years old. That way it will still be fun. I'd keep her name off of everything possible online to provide as much anonymity as possible.

As for the finances, personally, I'd put them in long term investments tied into a trust. If this has the potential to be as successful as you think it might, it would be worth setting it in trust with options for withdrawl for specific items like education and other necessities related to advanced education (ie: technology, a vehicle, travel, etc..) naming you as trustee with full distribution at 30. That way she won't squander it on fun stuff before it is used for the things that will actually give her a brighter future. I've seen too many people blow windfalls quickly. I remember a teen in college who spent most of an inheritance on buying friendships (drinks all around, concert tickets, etc.) and I've seen adults spend a million inheritance in a few short years living off of it instead of investing it and allowing it to continue growing. In that situation, they were almost broke by retirement and struggling to make mortgage payments.

THe best thing you can do for her is tying it up and teaching her about personal finance so when she does take it over she has the skills to continue to grow the money.",jaepsp6,N/A

She can also get a say in how she invests it (like buying Roblox stock, though she should also learn that buying individual stocks is a highly risky endeavor that should constitute only a small percentage of a portfolio that is heavily invested in broad market index funds), and get a real head start in terms of her financial literacy and well being.

I would suggest Investing majority of the money- avoid 529 college type accounts because your child may grow up and decide college is not for them. Especially if she continues down the content creator path, or becomes her own boss.

You can use this as an opportunity to teach budgeting and allow her a small *allowance* of her earnings to use as she pleases for whatever toys and stuff she wants. 

Assuming she’s taking in a few thousand dollars a month. I would allocate maybe $20-50 a week to her. Etc. Something like “oh, you want a new computer or this *AND* that. You’re going to have to save”. You can look up the 3 jar allowance method - it was posted here recently

And a lot of videos will likely be demonetized for unknown reasons. Ad revenue isn't much on Youtube anymore, sponsorships are where the money comes from. I wouldn't recommend going thew sponsorship route though.",jaim1hx,jae0doq

I would also tell her You get $X now (and can be used to pay for a new computer or expenses related to her business). We will invest $X or 50% in the 529 or other investment account, you can even get her involved with picking stocks or funds (SP500 vs individual stocks) which can be used for retirement or college (and if she makes significant money time value for retirement would be amazing). And maybe $X for charity or saving for a cause of her choosing. (If this aligns with your values)

You could also research with her high interest saving accounts with her so she can put money in now and see how earns free money. 

This is similar to the real world and can really teach her how to save for future. I would be open with her so this as an opportunity to educate/talk to her on finances to be a huge win. 

(And also set aside some for taxes depending on how much you think she will earn).",jah0rgj,jadb5le

Okay guys I desperately need advice. My son is 5 and became really interested in Minecraft and Roblox after he downloaded it a few months ago while at his grandmothers house. I’ve learned to play both of the apps with him to understand it better & see the positives. They’re fun games, I admit. My issue is every time he has to put the tablet away, he has a meltdown. Every time. The duration of these meltdowns vary but it’s stressful for us both.  Tonight I thought about just getting rid of the tablet until weekends to avoid this but I think you all may have more productive advice. How should I approach these meltdowns and tablet time? 

Things I’ve tried: 
1. Giving him 1 hour per day which he can earn more time or lose time based on behavior and activities (this is new but I’m iffy on this method) 
2. Setting a timer so he can see how much he has and giving frequent updates + Having a transition activity (which he rejects) 
3. Letting him just play all day, no limits (this did not work at all obviously) 

He is starting school next month which I hope will help naturally but for now he is home all day while I work. Any advice, tips, things I’m clearly doing wrong? Can’t put every detail in this post so ask if you need clarification on anything.",N/A,N/A

Would it be possible to set your own timer and give the opportunity for him to give it up on his own, but then set up a parental lock one as a backup so he doesn't even have the option to continue to play? 

I think if he has a meltdown, you just need to calmly explain you understand he's upset because playing the game is very fun, but we need to take breaks and give our eyes and brains some time to rest. If he continues to meltdown, just be available but don't respond to the tantrum.

The big problem I see with my own five year old is that he asks for video games when he's feeling too tired or uncomfortable to entertain himself. Playing a game and having to stop just delays satisfying the need he needs to satisfy, so he melts down at the end.

So, my rule is that before playing, he has to have had a drink, eaten something of substance within the last hour, and gone to the toilet. If there has been evidence of overstimulation or poor regulation during the day so far, he can't play (not as a punishment, but because he'll probably have more difficultly holding himself together). 

And then I set an alarm for twenty minutes if it's a solo game (like teach your monster to read) or half an hour for a game he needs help for (like Spiro the dragon). He can finish the level/life/savepoint stage after the timer goes off, but not start a new one.

After that, check in with bodily needs again, and maybe ease back to reality with a cuddle and a story.",ig3vrj0,N/A

No Switch tomorrow.”

And then don’t cave no matter what - that is the most important part. Every time he has the fit, he loses it for a day - potentially longer if a day turns out to not be long enough. My son is a bit older, so the “not good for your brain” has been explained more and now I can say that being addicted to video games isn’t good for his brain - and feeling this upset about turning them off is a sign that he’s getting addicted, so time for a game break.

Delayed when it is a natural consequence that was immediately explained is psychologically different.

A tweak that could be made to have it be even more of a natural consequence is to have a system where when he stops playing it, he plugs it in to charge for the next day.

I'm not saying a child should have unfettered access to something, especially if there's an addiction issue,  but the solution is setting boundaries and sticking to them or removing the item entirely,  not punishments lasting multiple days.

I'm not saying you should give it to him now if you've already said you weren't going to, the most important thing is sticking to the boundaries you've set,  and I'm happy that he's not fighting you about it now. Just saying that while things may seem like they work in the short term, they may have unintended consequences in the long term, because young children's brains just aren't wired the same way as an adults are.",ig5ngai,ig4mjcl

Hey gang,

&#x200B;

Got a message from her teacher today; LO just turned 5 in January. Teacher said LO was stirring her yogurt but not eating it (not terribly surprising to me) but we do usually stir up the yogurt before eating it. Teacher assistant asked LO if she was done and LO smarted off to her. 

&#x200B;

Teacher also mentioned she hasn't been playing/speaking nicely with her friends lately. 

&#x200B;

LO has been suffering from upper respiratory stuff since forever, we had her on a medication that was supposed to help deal with the symptoms but there was some recent research out that said some kids may suffer from side effects - depressed mood, etc, so we took her off of it. We hadn't noticed TOO much but she has been defiant / rude to her grandmother, who is her usual caretaker during the week when we're working. 

&#x200B;

Her little brother recently turned 1.5, and has been a handful, so he's getting a lot of extra attention of course, because of the fact that he's a toddler. I'm sure that's playing into it. 

&#x200B;

To be 100% truthful, she gets too much screen time. YouTube - usually gaming channels and family vlogs, I haven't seen much of what she's watching that is directly objectionable - and her tablet/Roblox on the laptop.

&#x200B;

After discussing with her mom what we should do, we've decided that less screen time and some time devoted exclusively for her each day should help. Personally, I'm fine with 100% cutting her off from YouTube, and overall restricting her (and our, to be fair,) screen time down to a more reasonable level. It's hard with her little brother, but they're worth the effort. 

&#x200B;

Do you have any other suggestions to help out? Experiences?  Our overall plan is, as stated:

More dedicated one on one time for her

Less screen time overall

&#x200B;

Any other suggestions? Thank you!",N/A,N/A

We wound up deciding that it was best to have no tablet time on weekdays and reserve it for the weekend. It really helped with his behavior in the evenings. I recommend giving it a try. It also sounds like some one on one time would be good, as well as maybe slightly earlier bedtime during the week.

It is awesome that you understand the importance of dedicated one on one time with her.  This time doesn't have to take a ton of effort - playing board games like Candy land, coloring, making something (like cooking or crafts) together as a family, reading books, going to the park, and just having fun together spontaneously are all ways that you can spend time with her and make her feel special.  This is a great time as well to work on modeling respectful ways to talk to others, take turns, share, etc.  Love and Logic is a great parenting program that can give you a lot of ideas!  They have a blog up in the right hand corner of their site, as well as free resources under the parent tab.  They also have resources to buy and can help you find classes in your area if you are interested in their program.  Hope this helps.  Enjoy having fun with your kiddos!",j6yqym9,N/A

No 5 year old should be on YouTube or Roblox. There are some creepy people on Roblox! Minecraft is a much much better alternative where she can actually create something instead of just hanging out on Roblox. 

Build small moments into the day to connect with her - even if it’s just taking 5 minutes to hear about how school went and really being present. Also - plan to do something each day. It’s winter and we all kind of feel tired. Like maybe Monday you cook dinner together as a family and you really make an effort to get her involved. Tuesday you go for a short walk even if it’s cold. Wednesday you go to the library. Saturday you plan an outing as a family to a local children’s museums or ice skating an indoor play place. Things to look forward.",j6ym8d9,N/A

She's still got an unhealthy relationship with technology, but it's much better than it used to be. We made changes incrementally and made sure to get her buy-in every step of the way. We used to limit her to 2 hours on weekdays, 3 on weekends but she would spend the entire time on YouTube. We recently changed it to unlimited time on weekdays and weekends, but we've limited YouTube to 1 hour. She will take a break from anything else to play with her toys or color, but YouTube would have her glued to that screen for hours on end.

For background Grandma (66) has always undermined my parenting.
She is getting better about it, but it used to be really bad. She would sneak my daughter (Kylee 12) candy and treats and stuff her full of all of the junk food her little heart desires to the point it started effecting her health and anytime Kylee wanted something weather it be toys or staying up late and I told her no she could run to grandma and even though grandma knows I said no she would say yes. Sometimes when Kylee would get in trouble for misbehaving grandma would argue with me along with Kylee trying to defend her. 

I bought Kylee an iPhone for her birthday a few years back and wanted a debit card to put on file so she could down load certain apps. I told her she can't use my debit card because she is a child and I don't want any surprise charges on my phone so she goes and asks Grandma and Grandma said yes. I explained to grandma why this was a bad idea but she did not want to listen. 

  Kylee asked grandma if she could get a 10$ monthly subscription to an app using her card, I said no because grandma is on a fixed income and can't afford to pay monthly subscriptions but grandma says yes. This leads to extra charges and grandma having to call the bank and cancel her card. I tell her not to let Kylee add her card to her phone again but she doesn't listen. 

    Grandma let's Kylee add her card to her phone again although I told them both she is not allowed to do this, this time it leads to Kylee signing back up for the 10$ subscription with Grandma's permission and using grandma's card to buy Roblox also with Grandma's permission. Grandma forgets she allowed Roblox (about 50$ worth throughout the month some as a Christmas present) and didn't calculate it in her budget then comes up short on money at the end of the month and cancels her bank card gets refunded the money but has to wait for a new card. Accept for this time I make Kylee Pay back half of the money.

  Well last night not even two weeks after grandma got her new card in the mail I find out she let Kylee put her card on her iPhone again and let Kylee sign up for a free trial on her phone as long as she cancels the membership before her card is charged. Nobody said anything to me about this and now 40$ has been charged to grandma's card from apple because Kylee thinks you cancel a subscription if you delete the app she has no idea what she was doing so after the trial is up grandma gets changed for the subscription. After Kylee leaves to school grandma comes up to me and says she doesn't know how we are going to do this if she should make Kylee Pay for the whole thing or only half. But I don't know if I am going to make Kylee pay her back at all I told Grandma to stop letting my child use her bank card on her phone but she keeps giving it to her anyways what should I do?",N/A,N/A

A 12 yr old is old enough to start learning financial responsibility. I personally would recommend a prepaid debt card that she can use for these subscriptions using her own money that she's been able to save up or that she works for. These can be reloaded when they run out which also gives you the ability to limit her on how much she can spend. If there's no money on the card her subscriptions will automatically cancel and you xan take the opportunity to teach her how to cancel the subscription she pays for. If a prepaid card feels like too much you can also manage subscriptions with gift cards that can only be used on specific apps. She needs to be able to see how her money is being spent. Teaching her how to use a budget can also help her. But this will only work if you follow through with establishing boundaries with grandma. I'd also give her an electronics time out. She abused phone privileges so she looses the phone for a set amount of time. When you give it back make sure she understands why she lost the phone and what the consequence was and that it will be taken away for longer if it happens again. If she values having a phone she will respect the boundaries. I might recommend that if a phone is important for communication then if the problem persists after taking it away more than once then you xan downgrade her to a flip phone that only has minutes. These were things my parents did in similar situations when I was her age and it made a huge difference. You got this mama!,j39v4lf,N/A

In fact I would take the phone away, it’s a privilege not a right. 

And going forward I would set app passwords so you have to approve them. I would also teach your child money management and set up a debit card to their name.

But with an allowance you should also think about having them budget for a few extra luxuries you provide for them so they can actually learn from this privilege.

That's what I would do. Kiddo wants them she can have them but paid for by some of her savings (and restrict how much she puts in the account/ on the card to her help budget and not spend it all)

Also a consequence for the kid and for grandma. 

This second time I would not pay grandma back as you gave explicit instructions that were ignored.

Equally the kid gets a phone ban for a week or two as she too ignored instructions.

Why on Earth have you let things get this far? Do you still live with your mother? Are you financially dependent on her…? Why are you letting her have unsupervised access to your child when she is setting such a horrible example?

First, take the phone away. Tell Kylee that since she has been repeatedly dishonest, gone behind your back and caused the same problem with it over and over again, she doesn’t get to have it. Get her one of those basic phones which can call, text and do pretty much nothing else. She doesn’t get access to anything with apps on it unless it’s childlocked, *you know how to use it*, and *she is supervised*. Tell her you’ll revisit this after this year, if her behaviour has substantially improved and there has been no more running to grandma behind your back for things she has been told no to.

In general, now is the time to start having consequences for that behaviour, because letting a kid get away with manipulation got you into this mess. If she runs to grandma to get something then the thing is taken away. If possible it’s donated to charity, if not it’s thrown away. If it’s food or an experience that can’t be taken away, then she loses privileges. Run to grandma for ice cream after you said no? Okay, no desserts/sweets for snacks for x time, *and during that time she doesn’t get to see grandma either*.

You need to have that same conversation with grandma. You’ve told her repeatedly to stop giving the child the card or otherwise spending money she can’t afford. Be clear that if she comes up short on money again because of doing this, it isn’t getting paid back. Be clear you will sell or donate anything she gives your kid behind your back, and that every time it happens there will be a time-out from visits and she won’t see you or kiddo for a while. Be clear that they will only be spending time together *with you supervising* until your mom proves she can be trusted not to encourage your daughter’s manipulative behaviour. Put your foot down.

Do exactly this with your daughter and sit down with grandma separately and discuss the real-world issues she's enabling.

2) theft
3) fnancial illiteracy 
4) deception and disobedience 
5) ruining her relationship with the bank!!!!!

She basically told us, in no uncertain terms that ANY online platform or game where chat is a function is a breeding ground for predators and it is never a matter of “if,” but definitely a matter of “when” someone unsavory contacts a child.  It’s not limited to Roblox, there were dozens of apps and games she listed that she regularly catches predators from…it was jarring and my husband and I just decided to not promote or allow those games for our kids.  They can play a lot of games (meaning we don’t punish them, we tell them why we don’t like certain games and we provide plenty of alternatives) but Roblox was a BIG one that the detective mentioned so we have sort of banned it from the get go.

Hi all! My son is 12 (only child) and he is struggling to make friends at school and has made a group of buddies online with similar interests that live in other countries. I worry that this is problematic for him to prefer these friends over his IRL friends?

More details (I apologize for the length) 
My son is great. His special interest is history. More specifically, military history. He had a core group of buddies growing up, but now that they are in middle school, everyone has dispersed and gone their own way. My son is now having a hard time relating to other kids his age.

He started playing Roblox a few years ago, and he formed a little “club” of (what I am hoping are) other kids- and they all build and play world war 2 games together. There’s one kid in particular who he has bonded with a lot. The kid lives in another country (as do most of the kids in his club). My son says that these kids are his best friends and are the only ones who he has common interests with. 

I’ve vetted these online kids as much as possible. I’ve read Roblox conversations with them and it all seems like normal kid talk? Recently, they did start a chat on discord so I’m monitoring that and again, just seems like 12 year old boys sending each other memes. His best friend in the group sent a voice message last week to the whole club, and it sounded like a 15 year old boy.. 

It makes me sad he doesn’t have friends in real life. COVID was hard for him and very isolating. Since then, he’s gotten closer with these online friends and I don’t know if this should be concerning to me? 

I’m glad he has kids to relate to, but it’s starting to get to the point where my son comes home frustrated every day because he says he’s “sick of the other kids” at school. It’s making me concerned and he has suffered from anxiety in the past because he tends to go very hard on himself with school work. He’s a perfectionist. 

Academically, he excels. He has straight A’s and has made honor roll every quarter. He is starting a chess club at school and is participating in a geography competition this weekend. 

I’m so proud but I worry about his preference for his online buddies over his real friends. 

Should I be concerned?

Is there anything I can do to better monitor his online interactions or vet these friends? 

ETA- please be kind! I’m a single mom working full time with autism and I am doing my best and everything I can to make sure he’s ok. I don’t want him to be lonely, but also don’t want him to isolate himself. 

I am in the process of finding a therapist for him, but there’s always a wait. His teachers say he’s doing great and his school counselor checks on him every month and reports back to me. She says he’s a delight. But he comes home annoyed and angry every day.",N/A,N/A

Not all kids have the ideal social circle at secondary/high school and my youngest didn’t really spread her wings until uni in that way. We had a tutor for her when she was doing her A levels and she told us her experience was also the same, and she didn’t really have that until she started uni either? I wouldn’t worry too much as long as he’s bringing home the grades, I also found that enrolling my daughter in tennis lessons really helped and she enjoyed it and it extended her circle a bit at the time xx",jag34mt,N/A

I have an app for my Internet (Spectrum), so I just time the access of his laptop. It’s a Godsend - I can turn it on and off at whim with the press of a button, if I wanted When it’s done, it’s done. I will typically warn him when it’s approaching, and sometimes he’ll be all ‘we’re in the middle of XYZ’ so then I sometimes make allowances of a few minutes to finish up.

And there were times when he was overloaded and I stopped him and he’d throw a tantrum and get pissed off, or whine, try to verbally ‘fight’ me like why can’t I just blah blah blah, mope, etc.  I’d usually ignore it.

I have a soon to be 8year old son, he has his own device which he mainly uses to play some games(Roblox, Island War, Subway surfer, etc..) and watch YouTube videos (Royalty Family, Lanky Box, 🏈 Football Highlights, and what not). But I've caught him watching twerking videos, with his wee wee up and touching it. 😂😅

Now I'm his father, and I understand getting to know his body is completely normal, I'm just worried he might be starting wayyy to soon. 
I've tried putting YouTube Kids instead, but he doesn't like it, YouTube itself doesn't let me block certain content(that I'm aware of), he does have restricted time with his device, but he likes to use the device in his room or living room by himself(and he is mostly playing and watching regular things on it). 

So, idk what to do, or where to go from here...
As of now I've just told him that I understand he likes those videos but he should wait until he is older to watch them instead of now, I've used the ""those videos are for teenagers and grown ups"", and he nodded and agreed to not do it but idk what else to do.

But I don’t understand why so many parents just hand a device over, and then do absolutely nothing else. No talking to their children about appropriate websites, no parent controls, no looking at their history. I teach elementary school and a regular issue we’ve had over the past few years is third, fourth, and fifth graders googling porn on their devices, and showing it to their friends on the bus.

Why do their phones need those capabilities???",j8yscgr,N/A

Hi! Just wanted to get some advise on how to deal with my son for our upcoming talk. 

I caught him saying sexual stuffs such as “69” to his online friends and “I want to f*ck your mum” as his discord status… 

Seeing those messages has got me worried and got me curious on what led him to say such things… he likes to play games such as minecraft and roblox. He’s homeschooled-online schooling, so his friends who likes to play games has a discord server that they use to socialize and use while they’re playing… he also watches a lot of YT videos of gamers. Thinking abt those two factors has led me to assume that he might have picked up some bad content from some gamers (I sometimes overhear them saying bad words or trolling words that are inappropriate) or some of his friends might have said it. But of course, I’m not totally sure

I just want to know how is the best way I can talk to him about this as I don’t just plainly want to say that its bad or shame him about it or say that he’s young enough to understand because he does and has already an idea to it.

1. Explain what is wrong and why it is wrong.
Throw in an explanation of what you felt when you saw this.

2. Monitor his activities. He's not old enough to navigate the complex social interactions on the internet on his own.
You need to have full insight into what he says in which settings. Get a keylogger in a worst case scenario.
It's either monitored internet or no internet.

3. STRICT end time for internet usage. Your router can most likely restrict when his devices can connect to the internet. Leverage it.

4. If he's on a Windows computer, use the parental controls from Microsoft to monitor app/game usage, browsing history and more.

5. Monitor YouTube activity. Review some videos.
There's SO MUCH GARBAGE. You need to know what he watches to get what cultural frame he is in. Disallow channels if necessary.

6. Cooperation with his friends parents will be important. If your kid says stuff like this, he's probably surrounded by others who also say similar things. You've gotta fix the problem in all ends or it'll just come back.",j890j4n,N/A

Maybe use this as a boundary if the behavior continues?

Honestly though, the behavior is pretty normal around that age group. Is it gross? Yes, absolutely. Have a talk with him. Sit down and discuss how the things he's saying are offensive,  how it makes you feel, and that you don't want him broadcasting that type of energy. Then you can wrap up the conversation with.

Well... at 9 it's quite early to have sexual interests, but then again I watched porn at 8 so can't judge.

So still within normal range, although suspicious.

My 10 year old twins have completely different personalities. Twin 1 got into all of this ""sex stuff"" a while ago, because he's more outgoing, and he belongs to a friend group with kids screaming ""69"" and ""Ooh daddy harder"" literally EVERY. SINGLE. FREAKING. SECOND. (I've been monitoring his interactions with this group.) Twin 2 is a bit more innocent and shy, and he hasn't even gotten the sex talk yet, (I was forced to give it to T1 because of an incident with his friends.) This innocence is slowly fading away because of school, and his brother and sister teaching him about all sorts of sexual crap. (I talked to them about it.) Both of them use messenger kids and discord. When T1 talked to his friends on discord, I caught him spamming 69 and things like ""U probably f\*ked \*girl's name\* last night"". Instead of panicking, I drank a glass of wine, and bought a book for the sex talk called ""sex is a funny word."" I taught him about how having sex is normal, and it's ok to be curious, but it is only for adults, and you should not talk/joke about this with friends. I also told him about how it's not ok to touch someone else's privates, and it's also not ok for someone to touch yours. (I mainly told him about this because one of his best friends is a girl, and I don't want anything to happen when they are both older.) It was kind of awkward, but now he knows wrong from right.

It seems to ebb and flow. She has type 1 diabetes, and as part of her care team, she has a psychologist that we work with to help her with her mental health. Lots of teaching through example and checking in with her. 

So my advice is this: the next time this happens, where you can see her mood turning difficult and disrespectful, take a step back and ask her is everything okay. If she gets defensive or rude, shoot her down calmly, explaining that you don't want to fight, point out that she seems stressed (because more often than not, in my experience, whatever is causing her stress or mood, usually has nothing to do with me at all) and say you're just checking in and you're there if she needs to talk. See if she wants a hug.

This tactic works almost every time for me and it teaches my daughter that she can come to me for support in times where things are getting the better of her. It shows her that we can tackle these problems together and that there's no shame in having her feelings and acknowledging them. We try to find proactive solutions to whatever is bothering her, which is a great tool for her to learn.

It also heads off a lot of arguments at the pass. So then when things are a bit calmer, I can talk to her about the value of being able to speak to each other with respect and understanding.

Obviously this isn't foolproof, and we've had plenty of arguments, and she can be a brat when she wants, but it's a great way to handle difficult moments, and not only with kids, I've found lol.

When someone (of any age) does stuff that is out of character, the first step is to mention this to them and ask them if they are aware of it, and why they're doing it.  people (of all ages) are usually pretty consistent, there's reasons when things change, and sometimes  they aren't aware of it.  so, best to first observe and question and respond to the reason.  then, you can ask them to talk nicely to you.  but going right for ""Stop it"" shuts that down and creates frustration and often exacerbates the underlying reasons for the behavior.",j51os5b,N/A

But yeah, it really depends on why she's yelling at you. If she's yelling to get you to do something, then tell her that you are uncomfortable with the way she's acting towards you, and you will only listen when she's able to communicate in a calm manner because it's hurtful.",j544a6u,N/A

The best you can do is be considerate and mindful that their heads are a mess.

Alternatively, as I am also from the south, I'll share what my mom did with my sister around that same age.  So, sis was mouthing off while mom was cooking one night, and mom kinda snapped - she didn't yell, she barely moved away from the stove.  Mom told my sister to go upstairs and pack her overnight bag, grab everything she thought she'd want... no one knew WTF, and we were all to scared to ask!  So, sis comes downstairs with her bag, mom shut off the stove and just left dinner sitting there, uncooked; mom tells her to get in the car.  My mom drove that kid almost 45m away, pulled over and got out her wallet.  Told my sister ""Its clear to me that you absolutely hate it at home, and hate me too, so - you're welcome to go on and live here, if you like..... I'll give you some cash, help get you settled."" LOL....  At first sis just stared at her, but mom stuck to the script, and sis eventually broke down crying, said she wanted to go home and she's sorry and she'll try to be nicer.   Now, I'm sure lots of people would consider this child abuse, or a form of it at least, but my observation as the older sibling, it seemed to very quickly get my sister's attitude in check, and changed her perspective, maybe helped her find gratitude.",j52608i,N/A

If you let it continue then that will be how goes from now on.

What does she do when you take away video games? Watch tv? play with toys? go play outside?

The simplest thing you can do is to have her sit on her bed. No toys, no tv, no games. When she is ready to talk like a big kid, she can come out. If she is still yelling or mad, she stays in there or goes right back there.

And I would stop with warnings. As soon as she yells, she goes to her room and sits on her bed.

Don’t be too mean but mean enough to make her feel you’re about to knock some sense into her. That’s how new generation brown parent’s discipline their child it works well at this age. But older gen (my parents grandparents) I would get shoes thrown at me. I’ve seen parents get disrespectful by slamming something on the counter raising their voice like “what did you just say” scare them a little but not too much that you have CPS at your door. 
Then take away the things she loves (phone iPad tv) first few days might be an attitude but she’ll come around just to get her things back.
Goodluck

I wanted to add
I don’t get how the kids now days have the audacity to be like this. Back in the day I was terrified of disrespecting my elders I think it’s a culture thing I am of middle eastern decent, it’s drilled in our brains since we are babies to respect our elders. If I tried this with someone in my family man I would get the beating of my life or the scariest yelling adult asking me who I think I am at 8 years old. You’ll tend to find middle eastern kids are less trouble for this reason. You gotta show tough love. I’m not sayin beat your kid because that’s wrong, plus I wouldn’t be an advocate for that.
 but nothing wrong with using your voice, your body language to show you are the adult.

It’s a tactic so long as it works. It shouldn’t work.
Then, it won’t be a tactic, it’ll just be a means to express their big emotions. 

We want to teach our kids other ways of self-expression, which we can do by modeling which is also where most of us fail. Going into war will only render losses in the long term sacrificing bits from the relationship.

The war is internal, within ourselves.

Putting aside our pain, and ego in the most heated situations and then, only when the child is ready and available to listen will we make our statement about what has happened and what is not tolerated, and why.

How to get your child attuned so you can speak?
Well, the easiest trick is to give them food. They can’t be TOO PISSED and eat simultaneously. Of course, not immediately after they misbehave or something…

Children don’t usually JUST misbehave consistently. I mean, having an independent todd wanting everything at the same time, not being able to say what it is that they want and being all enraged about it isn’t misbehavior — it’s called toddlerhood. So, as will all ages, there ARE some behaviors that are more or less representative of the developmental phase of the child. Just something to take in mind.",j54zm3o,j51zijd

I dont tolerate disrespect or backtalk. If my kid pulled behaviour like this I would be rather harsh with my discipline because I believe if you nip it in the bud young it's better. My daughter is 8 and knows if shes disrespectful to expect to lose alot of things she enjoys till i feel shes learned her lesson. 
Like when she threw a toy down the stairs at me cuz i told her it was bathtime. All her toys went in a trash bag for three days, no yelling no argument. I just bagged them up and told her if shes going to misuse her toys as a weapon she wont have any, if she behaves she will get then back. If she did it again I would donate them all. Shes never even tried to hit me again with anything, not even her hand. She was 4.",j51zr2a,j51y79b

Not permanently but long enough for the lesson to stick. Electronics are a privilege not a right. Kids can survive without them just fine so if they become a instrument in their bad behaviour it's easy to just take it away.,j5367z6,j52quep

Husband and I were talking and our almost 8 year old who has autism and loves roblox.. He's always hated him playing roblox but it's just something he loves to do after school and during the summer. I don't think it's a big deal and I think it'll phase out and I do think the autism plays part in him obsessing over the game. We agree he needs to kind of play other things and just branch out besides roblox. During the school year he only plays his tablet 5PM-7PM an gets an hour tv. There are times when he studies and does chores so that's why I just don't mind him playing roblox and doing something he thinks fun during his couple hours of tablet time. Hubby was just saying how roblox is just mind numbing but I feel like that's just any game. Games are just an escape and just to relax.

Hi, I am a Mom to an 8 year old boy. My mom has work up here and has been staying with us on and off for a year. It's been just fine. I found out I'm pregnant again and I don't know if I'm just hormonal or if I need a new strategy around the both of them. 

The problem
 

I've had issues with my son on yt. He has caught bad kid videos on there and I limit that screen time to as little as possible. He has access to TV and his nintendo and toys as well. He uses the phone to play roblox. I'm fine with all that, but yt is a sore subject. For game help and certain yt creators it's fine but he drifts off onto the shorts and I'm scared he will he exposed to something inappropriate. So today after doing yt and games he went to play in his room and I told him no yt for tonight, all done. I go to check on him an hour later and he's on yt. Watching something weird. I tell him he was told no, start to go into him going behind my back when my mom comes in and starts a whole rant cutting me off about how there can be bad videos on there and it's not his fault if those come on and yadda yadda yadda. 

I feel really annoyed and shut down by her about my own kid. I tell him no phone tonight n tell him he will have limited time tomorrow because he disobeyed and leave the room. She's in there extra long probably cuddling him about big bag mom.

She comes out into the living room and I tell her without him hearing that I dont appreciate her going off topic when I'm talking to my son about disobeying.

She tells me that if I want him to obey I have to explain it to him why there are dangers. I tell her I already have many, many times before and right then wasn't about the dangers of yt it was about being told no and then doing it anyway. She then remarks that I must not know he's only 8. Oh it pissed me off. I don't say anything and just calm down and then after a few minutes I go into his room and I talk to him about some things are fun on yt, but he needs to watch that in the room with an adult. Screen time is fine but when his time is up on it it's up and to do that behind my back makes me disappointed.  He understands and we hug it out. End of topic.

I go back out in the living room and tell her sorry and tell her I explained to him n she still acts all mad.

AITA? I feel like I might be. But she's also done this before. Sometimes, not every time I scold my kid or correct him she jumps in and tries to change the subject and talk to him about something else. 

I feel like its really rude. He's my kid to parent. I don't spank him, I don't yell, we talk about what he did wrong, why and either clean it up together or if it's really bad a time out. It's rare because he's a really good kid and usually nothing beyond ""hey let's not do that"" is all it takes. Just sometimes something like a breaking of trust is something I want to talk more about. I feel like she acts like she has to jump in or explain to him why I'm scolding him and it's really unneeded. We always talk about it. Either right away or a minute to cool down then talk. 

Am I just being too dramatic about this? Have you dealt with this? I don't want to be rude to her, but it is my house and I have a very good kid because I do parent him well. His father does live here too but is always working or doing his own thing. He's taken on double shifts and does what he wants on his time off. So majority of the parenting is me. I'm mom and dad to our son. Which means nurture and the talking to if needed. To me It feels like my mom is trying to take over the nurturing side entirely and leave me no room to do that n I'm stuck with the discipline side. Making me the bad guy constantly. And cuddling him after I speak to him. 

I'm not the best at being both parents. That's true. But I feel like I should be able to talk to my own kid without her buffering everything I say to him. 

Idk. If I'm being dramatic just please let me know. I tried to be as neutral explaining this as possible but I'm clearly biased to my own side. So take that with what you will.",N/A,N/A

First trimester for me has been really tough with food aversion so she has been cooking and cleaning up. I do as well of course, but I feel beholden to her because she has been an enormous help when she is here. I mean huge. And I just feel wrong arguing with her, but at the same time I don't want to be disrespected in front of my own kid. 

I have rule about no cereal at night. Especially when my son doesn't finish dinner. He's not a dinner person. Eats two bites n claims he's full. We don't force him to eat. But if he wants desert I say he has to eat some of the dinner before that or whatever. I include stuff on each plate I know for a fact he likes n will be easy to eat for this reason. Cereal is a huge trigger for my kid. He loves it, would eat it every meal if given leave to so I say no past breakfast time. 

Anyway one such night he had eaten some dinner (just the fruit) and nothing else and requested food at bedtime. I told him no on cereal because he asked (he always asks for it) and told him I'd get him something else. I go potty and come out to the kitchen to see my mom and son and they're like ""she's coming she's coming"" and my mom tells me to go to bed and she's handling it and I see in there she'd pouring him some damn cereal! It was our first run in and I let it slide, figured it was a fun grandma thing and let it go. 

A week passed and I decide to just nip the problem I had with it and buy healthier cereal alongside the regular stuff. If he did good on dinner, it's too late for sweets, and he's hungry at bedtime then he can have some of the healthy cereal. It's good, it has berries n has honey. It's delicious. Just isn't bright red n have 28g of sugar before bed. Anyway he gets some of the healthy cereal and I tell him to bring what's left of his bowl of cereal into bed for story time and I see he's got some left but the rest is what looks like a huge handful of the sugary red cereal. 

I start asking him why that's in there n he tells me grandma said he could have some to make it taste good.

After we do bedtime and everything I quickly explain to him the sugary stuff makes it hard to sleep and not good at bedtime and he says sorry and we hug n its okay.

I go out to the living room and tell her she is so rude for doing that when told her I didn't want him having any of that at bedtime and she starts telling me it was only a little handful. It was behind my back and it made me angry. I just kinda huffed n went potty. I'm pregnant. I'm always going potty. Anyway when I come our she's in my kids room explaining to him how she did wrong and we shouldn't break moms rules n then she apologized to me too after. Which made me feel like a jerk for even getting mad about it..

Idk I feel like I'm being undermined. A lot. 

And my husband is 90% at work, and on his one day off he plays video games with our kid n house stuff and is then left to have his free time. He busts his ass for us and I know she understands that. It's just me being both mom n dad n I love my mom and I so appreciate her help she is a complete blessing but sometimes I wish she would let me parent. She was never strict with us as kids. My dad spanked before ever asking about why we did something we weren't supposed to.  So I think that traumatized her to buffer any kind of scolding or punishments. Like I said, I don't spank, I don't yell, usually talking is all thats needed. Time out but it's so rare these days. I dont get why she's protecting him from me so hard sometimes when I don't feel like I'm doing anything to him that is even close to needing protecting. 

Trying to keep respectful but also not lose respect either is such a fine line",ja6pytt,ja6nblp

I'm going to try to talk to her as it comes up. The few times I have talked to her I make sure my son is out of earshot. I know she's grandma and doing fun stuff is part of that MO. Which is why I let a lot slide sometimes but when she's here 5 days a week sometimes all week it feels like her ways are taking over mine. Fun stuff is fine but I want my rules followed in my home most of the time. Which they are for the most part.  

I love her but we don't get a lot of alone time lately as a family. Like one day a week. Sometimes I just want things to be a little normal and feel like I can talk to my child without my mom breathing down my neck about it. 

I'm also pretty hormonal right now and sometimes I realize in time I'm making a mountain out of a molehill and maybe i just need to step back too.

She knows my rules. I dont have many, but for ones I do have I don't want to be ganged up on by both or them. I feel like I'm losing my place as the mom in my own house and I think that's making me feel a little insecure about it all and blowing stuff up in my mind. I've only talked to her about it twice. Once with cereal thing and second tonight which didn't go well. She was mad at me n didn't understand at all why I was upset. 

Just feels kind of pointless. Even though she is here n it feels like she's taking over my role it's not actually happening. I'm still the mom, it's still my house. I love having her here I just wish I didn't feel this way. 

I'm beyond lucky to have this time with her as she lives far away. I've seen her more this year than in the last 10 years. It's amazing to bond and spend time together. I just want my own space as a woman too sometimes more than  one day lol. I think that might be the root of my issue and there is no fixing that right now",ja6swle,ja6roci

So my kid, (10f) plays Roblox on my old phone.  Apparently my credit card was on that phone in the Google account??  So in the last few months she’s managed to rack up almost a thousand dollars.  I only found out cause my visa was maxed out. 

Problem is, it’s partially my own fault.. I didn’t double check the card was removed and I didn’t double check my visa statements.   
But I know she could see that money was ‘magically’ making its way into her roblox account. 

So now we are trying to figure out a decent punishment..no amount of extra chores or no allowance is going to cover this..
She’s banned from roblox right now, but I feel like it’s a punishment for us too..when she plays with her friends online it’s a little break for us.  But she obviously has to learn that money isn’t going to magically appear in her account.

Instead think of this as a financial skills lesson: she racked up debt, she now has to learn how much work is involved to pay it off. So her chores around the house are standard. How about assigning dollar values to “extra” tasks that she can use towards debt repayment, alternatively she can ply her labor around the neighborhood by walking dogs, weeding gardens, pooper scooping other yards etc.

And truthfully, even if the kid didn’t understand that it’s linked to mom/dad, it’s linked to *something*. So did 10 just think she was getting away with something? Where did she think the money was coming from?

Can't hurt to call the CC company. You probably won't get it all back, OP, but you might get something back.

And, to be honest, I'd ban Roblox until she paid off her debt. This is about a THOUSAND dollars, not thirty or fifty bucks. That's a very expensive lesson. She might need to call up some relatives to see if they have work for her to do to earn some money, and that'll take up some of that time on weekends that would give you a 'break' while she would have played.

Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1016qo0/my_husband_thinks_our_daughter_is_terrified_of_me/,My husband thinks our daughter is terrified of me. I've never laid a hand on her...,Kittenknickers333,2023-01-02,1672645220.0,31,"My husband thinks our daughter is terrified of me. I've never laid a hand on her...
We have a 5yo little girl with ADHD. She is not medicated. My husband travels for work so I'm left to parent alone 5 days out of the week, sometimes 6. That means I do all the fighting about homework, tooth brushing, bed time and so on. All alone. So far, the consequences of my husband's work has been that I am the bad cop and he the good. He comes in on Friday night with a patience cup full to the brim and therefore, very rarely runs out of patience when it comes to our daughters defiant behavior and big emotions. 

I deal with them as best I can, but obviously, I'm more worn down. Yes, I lose patience and get snippy. I have a tone of voice my daughter calls ""yelling"" and she gets upset when I use it. No I do not raise my voice unless she's across the house and can't hear me. 

Tonight was a Sunday on winter break so we spent the day in just playing games and relaxing. As per usual, my daughter asked me to play roblox with her. I said yes. 

As bed time ran nearer, my daughter began to get upset because I wasn't playing right. This is standard for when we play together. She's extremely controlling and also a sore loser, so if she's not blaming me for making her lose, she's mad at me for not playing like how she wants. When she started getting upset, I told her if she couldn't calm down we would have to stop playing. This is a regular consequence for when she starts having a tantrum. This made her upset and she ran to cry in the hallway. 

My experience with her told me to just leave her alone to work it out by herself. She's doing what I told her to do, calming down. If I try to talk to her while she's in this state, it tends to trigger an even larger tantrum. 

My husband came out of the bathroom and discovered her there. He asked her what was wrong and she told him. We were playing a game and she wanted me to play a certain way and I told her no, I play my way with my computer and she has my laptop to play her own way. We were still in the same game, still playing together, just different ways. My husband tried explaining that to her and she started screaming at the top of her lungs. That's when I decided it was bed time, we will not play if she's going to throw a fit. 

As always, my husband thinks he can handle it so he tells me to feed the dog while he talks to her. I go. When I come back, he has her tucked in bed and very angerly tells me we have to talk about ""how I deal with things"" 

At first he tells me that I have to control myself and not get angry because our daughter is upset. I told him I didn't feel angry because she was upset, i was frustrated. I didn't yell, but I did have a tone when I told her it was bedtime. 

I feel like it's pretty normal to be frustrated when a child is throwing a fit, my husband thinks it's abusive. 

He then told me that she said she was hungry. He told her he'd get her some food, and she said no because I'd be mad at her. The reason she said this is because the rule is no eating after brushing your teeth. We always have to fight her so hard most nights that it's not worth it to have her do it again. My husband came up with this rule himself but since he's not here 70% of the the time, I am the enforcer of that rule, and all rules. She had brushed her teeth and she knew I wouldn't approve of the food. 

I thought this was a normal child worry. No kid wants their parents to be mad. But my husband took this as evidence that my daughter who has never been screamed at or spanked or even slapped on the wrist, is terrified of me. I don't even give this kid time outs anymore! Not since she was 3 and we started suspecting her Adhd! I stick strictly to consequences. She would not have gotten in trouble for eating but yes, I'd get annoyed and make her brush her teeth again. 

I'm so hurt by what my husband said. He thinks that I shouldn't give her any consequences for getting angry at the games either. I should just let her feel her feeling and continue on like nothing happened, even if she screams at me, even if she knocks things off tables and rips up papers. I am to let her do it and because anger is a valid emotion. 

I'm floored, to say the least. I don't even know what to say. I'm here to get some validation that I'm not insane and that I'm not causing trauma to my daughter.",N/A,N/A

My son isn't medicated because it's not general practice in my country to medicate kids with ADHD. I have a nice relationship with my son. He confides in me, he likes to spend time with me and wants to include me in his activities. But I'm not a robot. I get snippy sometimes, I get frustrated sometimes and even angry (rarely, but still). I don't scream at him or hit him. My husband is in the ""good cop"" department too. It's pretty easy for him to be in that role since he's away so much, so I'm mostly the one enforcing the rules. And bingo, my son is ""afraid of me"". At least, that was what I thought because I had the feeling he valued my opinion too much, he used to tell my husband sometimes ""mom will be upset if I do this or that"", as he got older he had those sprouts when he would try to take care about me too much... I talked about it to his psychiatrist and psychologist. During one assessment, a long time ago, my son turned his head towards me before answering to almost all the questions the psychologist asked him. I couldn't understand why he had the need to do that, looked like he wanted to check on me and my reaction before talking and it looked to me like he was afraid of my reaction. It broke my heart to see that and I couldn't understand where that fear was coming from. Both the psychologist and the psychiatrist told me it's not fear as I understand it and I'm doing nothing wrong. When one parent is more or less absent a child takes notice of that fact and sees the mostly present parent as his one and only lifeline. Kids are subconsciously aware that the only thing separating them from the outside potentially ""threatening"" world are their parents. Usually the ""pressure"" is equally divided between both present parents as they are both viewed as lifelines, but when one parent is absent most of the ""pressure"" can be put on the present parent. In other words the child feels like the present parent is their ""rock"" and their only ""protector"" so they can shape their behavior accordingly. Apparently it's a perfectly normal reaction psychologically speaking. The other parent falling into the ""good cop"" role is also expected and common in those kind of scenarios.  Anyway, you and your child aren't the real problem here, your husband is. He should be aware that it's so very easy for him to play the ""good cop role"" since he's not there a lot. He should also understand that it's perfectly normal for you not to completely hide your emotions in front of your child as long as your behavior isn't abusive (and it isn't). Hiding your negative emotions would send your daughter the message that her negative emotions aren't normal either and that she should completely hide them too which is not a good path to take. We all have negative emotions sometimes, we all get frustrated and upset sometimes, but what is important is how we react to those emotions. Not screaming, being aggressive in any way is the way to go. So when I get angry or frustrated while enforcing a certain boundary and my son can see it I don't hide it or negate the way I feel. If he asks me if I'm upset, I tell him in a calm voice what I feel (short sentence) while keeping enforcing the boundaries and telling him that even though I'm upset in that particular moment I love him very much and I always will. 
My child's psychologist told me a year ago that our relationship is a delight to see, so I must be doing something right. I still think my son values my opinion too much and I'm working on him ""not caring much about what I think"" which my child's psychologist told me is so funny for him to see since people usually complain about the opposite behavior. Lol
Maybe talk to your husband, try to bring him to your child's specialist and voice your concerns there. It might help him understand you and your child more and deal with the situation with more understanding. Even if he's in a ""good cop"" role generally speaking, you should present a united front whenever your child is misbehaving because a child will use the rift they sense between their parents to their advantage to manipulate the situation and get what they want. ADHD doesn't mean your daughter  cannot be misbehaving and needing to be corrected. Sometimes it's hard to see a difference between the diagnosis and misbehaving, but it can be seen and a specialist can help you with that part too (I know it helped us).

At the same time, you need a break if you’re losing your temper with her. If she thinks you’re yelling, it really doesn’t matter the semantics of it. It’s clear that you are stressed. Can you hire a sitter one or two nights a week while he’s gone? 

Another thing- losing is EXTREMELY hard for children with ADHD. It’s something we have worked on a long time with my son. Is she on therapy?

I can't say who is right or wrong, probably everyone (you your daughter and your husband) are all right in some ways in this situation. She should be allowed to feel her feelings but you have to teach her healthy coping mechanisms and emotional regulation not just consequences.

It's a tough life for sure (I know first hand, except I don't have a husband who comes home sometimes), but your mind frame on it is what will make it good or bad. Some days seriously just suck but MOST days are going to be defined by your mindset.

Your frustration with your husband I completely understand. Unfortunately he's not going to see it from your view because he's only doing a fraction of the parenting so he can't understand.

Take your mom power back. Handle this with both hands on the wheel. Your kid needs some grace and patience. Eating after tooth brushing a few times will not rot out her teeth. She needs to follow the rules, but whatever happened the night you made her brush her teeth stayed with her in a bad way. She likely was scared. Otherwise I doubt she'd even remember it by now. Learn to let the reins loosen up a bit. Only then can you truly guide your family from the front. A parent who sees their kid as a chore and micromanages their child always appears weak and like a challenge to be defeated for the child. She'll relax when you do.

I have ADHD myself, also unmedicated, something that seriously has helped is DBT and using the skills that are taught in DBT. You can find free copies of the skills online if you want. 

I feel like you were handling it properly, your husband just hasn't gotten the full picture of what happens when you're parenting. He might need to take a step back and just observe for a bit to see what happens, then you both can make adjustments. Your daughter also is dealing with her father being gone a lot and could possibly be dealing with some emotional issues regarding that. If anything a feeling of ""it's dad again, yay!""

My husband and I talked this morning about how my daughter feels and we asked her a lot of questions. Apparently she's scared of making any adult with authority mad, including her very sweet soft spoken angel of a kindergarten teacher.  My husband admitted that he over reacted but still thinks I need to control myself better. 

At this point he started playing with daughter, and she started getting frustrated with him. He didn't react. Then she had an outburst and he didn't react besides telling her he's listening. Then she said something she never has before. She called him a bad dad. He didn't react, only said he was sorry she felt that way. Then she said he was the worst parent in the whole world. 

At this point I intervened. I asked her why she was saying such a terrible thing and she said because it doesn't make daddy mad, she can say whatever she wants and daddy doesn't care. He seemed very shocked by this and asked her why she thinks those words don't hurt his feelings. She answered ""because you don't act like they do."" 

This makes a lot of sense why she gets in trouble at school for being mean to boys but never girls. I thought it was because these boys are being taught to never stand up to girls because they are the weaker sex, but it's really because she is learning that there are no consequences for disrespecting a male. 

My husband is very taken aback by all this. He's not convinced he's wrong yet, but he's seeing it. I have hope.",j2nxexm,j2me70q

My husband and I both decided this has to be a rule because if we were flexible with it, it wouldn't just be a sometimes thing where she has a snack before bed, she'd come to expect it every night. Of coarse I am flexible when flexibility is needed. In cases where she is sick, or otherwise couldn't eat, of coarse I feed her when I believe she is actually hungry. She brushes her teeth 5 minutes before bed so it's not like she has to go hours being awake without snacking, I also always ask if she'd like a snack before telling her it's time to brush her teeth. This night we had just had a late ish dinner so she said no. 

I often try very hard to look at things from her perspective, I have a very good memory of being her age. I accomodate where I can, and also have ADHD. There are certain aspects to being a child with ADHD that you seem to not understand 

I never said that I win on purpose. Roblox is an online game and sometimes her falling and dying while I don't is out of my hands. She considers this losing. Also when another player wins and we both lose makes her just as angry and that is also out of my hands. The only way to win sometimes is to become a better player and sometimes that means you have to lose a lot before you win. When I say I play my way, I mean I refuse to be bossed around and controlled like a doll. In this case we were playing a game about working at a pizza place, so there's no winning or losing just role playing.  ""No mom, don't stand over there, stand over bere."" ""You have to drive me around but not like THAT."" ""You have to help me with my house but you can't have a house."" 

I try to picture what would happen if she played with another child this way and I always see it ending poorly. What I allow her to do to me is what she will think other people will accept. I'm trying to create a palatable person who is capable of keeping friends. That may sound harsh to you, but I stand by it.",j2qzcf6,j2qa64v

I would not recommend group therapy for your daughter at this point. That's because young children with ADHD will benefit more from one on one therapy, especially when there are problem behaviors at home and/or at school that are not being resolved. Group therapy is better for children who have progressed past the point of needing one one therapy. My son (11) has ASD/ADHD and he's starting group therapy after about 5-6 years of one one one behavioral therapy. He's past the point of needing behavioral intervention and he's moving to group therapy as a way of learning social skills that he lacks. I would recommend finding a good behavioral therapist in the area. 
2. One thing that really helped me at home with my son was the use of a [positive reinforcement behavioral chart.](https://www.parentingforbrain.com/behavior-chart-chore-chart/) We used it to help him learn how to 'lose' as well as other behaviors we wanted to help correct. 
3. Does your daughter have a 504 in school? I ask this because sometimes kids with ADHD struggle to behave at school at all day and then come home and meltdown...especially girls. A 504 can help alleviate some of this pressure. 
4. It's really important to get on the same page with your husband on how to parent your daughter. Have you considered couple's counseling?",j2m05rf,j2lyq1v

School groups are band aids not going to the doctor.  It is not the school's role to treat the ADHD, although it is their role to support the student as much as possible.

What I would recommend:

1. Your child has a diagnosis and you aren't treating it.  It sounds like you've adapted your parenting and there are some supports at school, but most kids need more to be successful.  It's fine if you don't want to do meds - although they can make a pretty huge difference for some people - but she needs to be in some kind of therapy.  Many of these will include a learning program for parents which would be helpful.

2. You should be getting some kind of break.  Are you working or do you at least have down time during the day?  Kids are exhausting and high-need kids with no back up parent (and an undermining one is worse than none) are extra exhausting.  You will parent best if you have time to yourself.  I'm not saying that you were yelling; Kids always say adults talking to them in a stern voice are yelling.  Just that you deserve some time to breathe.

3. I don't know what it takes to get you and your husband on the same page parenting wise, but it is critical.  She needs you to be a team.",j2m3qr4,j2lyq1v

Nope for so many reasons. Number 1 being that you do 70% of the parenting- no fault of his. 

It sounds like you have your routine down and it works for you. 

It also sounds like she is pulling the typical for this age bs of.pushing limits.

Put dishes away and load dish washer, keep room clean, put laundry away (I don’t even make her fold her clothing, just keep it organized.) this is a HUGE problem for her, it took her 6 days to complete this task, I then found clothing shoved under the bed behind dresser etc. I’ve explained to her that doing this makes it more difficult then just doing the original task. Her issue is that we make her do the chores (because her friend don’t have to do chores) and she can’t have her cell phone during the week( we make her earn it because nothing is free in the world and we’re trying to teach her this and to be a functional adult when the time comes, she also has restrictions on the phone, no YouTube, no Roblox nothing that is social media based I’m trying to keep her safe but also allow her to talk to her friends that we don’t live around anymore due to being a military family.)

I know at times I can be a little strict but I am becoming more aware of how I’m handling things and trying to “pick my battles” if you will.

We have spoken to her and told her how we want her to excel as an adult and why we really want her to thrive as a child as well and what that means all together, we are doing a chore chart to earn chore bucks so then she can cash in the chore bucks for cell phone time and friend time and even a toy here and there 😊. This weekend has gone a lot smoother and she was able to stay the night at her friends house, we have also labeled where clothing goes etc. for her chores to get done properly. 

As for the friends getting everything they want with little to no expectations and my daughter wanting that, idk how to handle it. I’ve explained to her 1. We can’t afford that and 2. We need to learn how to work for what we want in life and it will help her in the future to learn that now.

My (44F) son (almost 10) told me something about himself the other day and I have been thinking of it so much since we talked about it. 

We were watching a show together and he turned to me and said, ""Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about."" So I turned the TV off and gave him my full attention because it sounded different than just a ""I did this cool thing at school/I played Roblox and../So and so said..."" etc. 

He said, ""I'm pretty sure I don't like girls, and I only like boys.""

I almost exploded with pride. He and I are very close, and it is something I have suspected about him for a very long time... I can't really say why, it is just a mothers intuition. But I've never told him as such. I've only taught him since he was old enough to understand, that everyone is free to love who ever they want to love. That families can look different than ours (a peaceful split with his dad when he was 3.5) ...some have two moms, some have two dads, some dads sadly passed away, some only have their mom to live with. 

What I was proud of was the fact that not only he felt comfortable being open enough to have that conversation with his parents (he told me he also had talked to his dad about it as well), but that he had the emotional intelligence to understand what he's feeling and to put it into words. 

I just smiled and thanked him for sharing that with me and that I'm proud of him for doing so. I did go on to say that he doesn't have to figure any of this stuff out right now, but am glad he is aware of how he's feeling at this point in time. I said, ""maybe you won't feel the same about it in a few years, and maybe you will feel like this and more! But no matter what, I'm just so proud that you're my kid and you can like who ever you want to like."" Then thanked him again for sharing that with me. He basically said, ""cool"", and we started watching our baking series again. 

I'm really hoping I handled it well. I started to doubt myself a little bit afterwards because I said the thing about how he may not feel like this later. But at any rate, I just wanted to say how proud I am of him for feeling like he can be himself. Things have certainly changed a lot since I was his age and I'm very glad for that.",N/A,N/A

Straight people usually never declare their straight feelings of attraction to the opposite gender to their parents. They just eventually bring home somebody to meet their parents and nobody bats an eye.

Also: it's never too early to discuss safe sex practices in an age appropriate way. It's not just pregnancy that's a risk and young queer folks are also more frequent targets for adult predators. It sucks but you can't ignore reality and better safe than sorry.",j0fzqs9,j0ef774

Obligatory on mobile and I’m exhausted so please excuse any errors. 

Tldr since this got longer than expected. I think my son is acting up because I’ve had a baby, how can I help him? 

I have 2 kids my son is 8 and daughter is almost 5 months old. We’re on the waiting list to have my son assessed for autism so I do try to keep that in mind but his behaviour and attitude is becoming horrendous lately and I really don’t know what to do. He adores his baby sister and he wants to play/cuddle with her all the time but it’s too much. I can’t leave him alone in the same room as her anymore to even run to the toilet because he picks her up, I’ve explained to him so many times why he can’t do that and how dangerous it is but no matter what I say he’s convinced nothing bad will happen and it’ll be fine. He throws toys when he has a meltdown or swings them around when he’s playing usually close to the baby. When he does this I take away the toy until the next day but he’ll just pick up a different one and do the same. So then he has time out which is spent with him screaming and crying the entire time.

In the last 2 weeks he’s started waking her up, sometimes it’s an accident but it’s usually on purpose, literally every time she falls asleep or starts dozing off, i tell him why he can’t do that but he either completely ignores me and carries on or says sorry, stops for a little bit then starts up again like he’s forgot. He’s started bragging to other kids that he doesn’t listen to me (so he clearly knows what he’s doing is wrong), he argues about everything and anything possible, even when I agree with him about something he argues wtf? It’s so mentally draining.

I try to stay as calm as possible and talk it through with him but he ignores me or shouts at me that he knows but then still continues. I know it must be hard for him having a new baby in the house when it was just me and him for so long and it’s even harder since I’m ebf, so when baby is eating or sleeping I help him with his homework, we’ll play a board game or Roblox together (he’s not allowed to play online games unsupervised and it’s easier for me to know what’s going on if I’m in the game with him, I can see the chats). We do movies and snuggles, we’re reading the Harry Potter books together. I don’t know what else I could be doing to spend quality time with him so he doesn’t feel left out and I don’t know how to combat the behaviour and attitude. 

He goes to his dads most weekends and his dad tried to talk to him about this but had just as much luck as me. He has another sister (5) at dads and I recently found out that he’s hit and spat at her. This is beyond unacceptable and disgusting and I told son that when I heard about it. I honestly didn’t think he would ever do something like that. He’s always been so kind and sweet, I don’t recognise who he’s becoming. Any advice is more than welcome.",N/A,N/A

When I place my body in between them he shouts her name or makes loud obnoxious screechy noises.

She’s ready for bed by 6 and wakes up to eat long after his bedtime so he has 2 hours of undivided attention if he just lets her go to sleep.

For Christmas my 10 year old daughter made the dreaded switch (dreaded for me!) to an iPhone. This is a staggering amount of information and freedom right at her fingertips. I did not gift it to her, but I also didn’t object outwardly so I’m as much to blame as anyone else. My daughter is exceptionally well behaved, a great friend and student. I honestly don’t worry about her as much as I would expect. She’s turning into a wonderful young woman. 

When asked if I snoop on her phone, I will admit to looking through her phone every once and a while to make sure she’s doing the right thing and not in danger.  Last night I looked through her phone for the first time in around a month and I found some things that are troubling. 

I found she sent a gif of anime characters touching a girls boobs to her friends, I found a video of Roblox characters humping each other and saying things like “ooh yea gimme more” (as an example), I also found her texting boys and girls making what I would call advances toward them. Advances like saying she likes them and thinks they’re cute/hot. She was rejected by one boy and said “ok I’m a lesbian now” and legitimately put rainbow ribbon in her hair and came out to me as a lesbian….(which if she is I of course stand beside her as her #1 fan and I made sure she knows that)

What I’ve found troubling also is that she is the only one of the kids she texts that’s doing things like this. When she does these inappropriate things she is overwhelmingly rejected and told to stop, but it doesn’t seem like she’s getting the message. 

Do I make it known I’ve seen these things on her phone? How do I approach this odd behavior?

For reference I’m a youngish single dad and figuring this parenting thing out as I go.

The lesbian comment...is just weird. She can be attracted to whoever she wants but being turned down by one guy is not cause to change your sexuality. That's called an overreaction and she should work on that. I'd talk to her about how to handle being turned down.

My oldest loves crochet now and does that over iPad a lot . My youngest uses her no tech days doing a variety of hobbies as well . Sketching , painting, diamond art etc . I truly feel if they had more electronic time they wouldn’t do these as much . 

I do allow YouTube time on no tech days if it’s tutorials for their art . Which there are so many these days for just about everything . 

I’d suggest sticking to your guns on the time limit . That’s already plenty .",j5firn7,N/A

well this is probably a bit more complex.

for some context, i live in Asia, people are generally nice, but there are some perks that are just off.

my 9Year old Daughter doesn;t even understand what ""to be considerate"" means.

as example her mother sleeps in the same room as her, she playing Roblox and voice chatting with some neighbor friends .. but she does it in a manner which makes impossible for her mother to sleep.

she isn't a bad girl or whatever, its just somethings people around here don't really do.  
like another example (adult) when i drive the car with more people in it, i choose the parking to ensure everyone gets out easy and maybe place the car in a direction where disavantaged passengers will have it more easy, this is somethings you will never see happening around here.

again its not bad people, just different culture. but i for once find the fact that people not considered at all in a country where the nicety of people is one of the things that makes them stand out for the rest of the world quite bad.

so the question here is, how do i teach my daughter to be considerate, without forcing it on her, and without having any support from the sourrounding society?",N/A,N/A

This is something that occurs between 10 and 13 on average. This is the best time to teach empathy and emotional intelligence. First, model the behavior yourself. Second, talk with her about how others feel. Do it as an exercise and not a lecture: “do you remember that very angry person in front of us at the shop; what to you think they were feeling? How do you think they were making others feel? What would have been a more considerate way to act?” 

Over time, you can turn this into conversations about her behavior. “When you do this, how do you feel? How does it make others feel? What would have been a more considerate way to act?” Don’t treat it as punishment. 

Wisdom and compassion come in one of three ways: you learn it through personal experience, you learn it from the wisdom of others, or you learn it through therapy or academic study. Personal experience is normally negative: like when you do the wrong things and reflect on the social consequences. Wisdom from others is modeled and taught. Therapy only works if the person wants to change. Academically it only works if that a desire for the person to lean. 

That means the only control you have is to model the behavior and share your wisdom. Reinforce these lessons with love and affection to remind her that in the journey she is still accepted by you. Do this now because waiting until she is 15-18 is going to make teaching it that much harder. 

Also, now is a great time to find that second voice. Parents at this age of a child become less wise/cool in the eyes of a child. Having a mentor, coach, or teacher reinforce those values as a second voice can be a game changer. Finding ways to let her connect with someone outside of the house can really help in the context of teaching emotional intelligence, compassion, and wisdom even if those lessons don’t take hold for another 5 years.",j95aakm,N/A

my ""mom is sleep"" example is a good one, she woke up shortly after, got dressed and went to do something else cutting her sleep in half as she has to go to work night shift in a few hours, but all of this did happen with zero conversation about it. 

my wife just takes the hit on sleep, and moves on, and in turn the child doesn't learn that this is really bad behavour, i can't really step in in this situation, as this would undermine my wifes authority (?).

I have multiple times/week a conversation with her about some things that happen like in school, which are 100% the result of her not giving a shit about other people feelings. so i usually be calm and try to explain it, asking how she would feel if a friend just abandoned her because there another kid in school that's cooler now... or somethigns like that. She does understand it the message, and makes up a resolution on her own as a conclusion, but the implementation is rare as the rest of society isn't really wired like that.

There was one ""teachable moment"" a few weeks ago, as she did manhandle the cat's like all the time, despite me telling her that this isn't a nice thing to do and just because the cat trust her, and is much smaller than her, does not provide automatic permission to do this.

At some point i just started to do the same to her, and right after asked her opinion about how it feels, after telling me .. i just responded .. ""now you know how the cat feels"" :) 

that actually worked, she stop doing it. even if i'm not around, but that happend in the concealed space at home, where i have full control about everything that happens, once i'm out of sight, this things usually just snap right back to business as usual.",j95esqh,j95aakm

I’m not a regular member of this sub but I’m hoping to get some advice on this situation. 

My 9 year has always been a fairly easy child. Every step on my journey of being her mom has been easy. She’s always very respectful and well behaved, highest praises from every teacher she’s had, and very emotionally mature for her age. After I separated from my husband almost a year ago, I was convinced by family members to get her a phone for my safety as my husband had gotten physical with me before he moved out. My family was worried that if he ever showed up to try to hurt me no one would be around to help.

After getting her phone I started seeing little red flags here and there; she was always on FaceTime with her little group of friends and from what I was hearing they seemed like a bunch of little drama llamas. But I remember being her age and although I didn’t love it, I recognized that it was normal. I’ve never had any reason to not trust her. I had parental controls on her phone and since she is underage it was my Apple ID that was used on her phone, where my debit card is linked. She still needed me to enter my password to download apps and such so I always knew what she was up to. 

I’m a single mom to my two girls. We’re a one income household and I don’t get financial support from my STBX. I make $22/hr and it’s enough to pay the bills and necessities but there’s very little left for unnecessary expenses. I’m expecting a promotion with a much higher salary soon and I had a nice little cushion in my bank account from my Christmas bonus. For the first time in months I had more than a single digit number in my account on payday week. Things were looking hopeful. 

My brother sent $100 through Zelle for my daughter to buy Robux for Christmas and with my permission and help she’s been buying here and there. I was at work one day and she wanted to buy some and asked for my password so my mom could help her with it. As I said, great kid and no reason to not trust her. I reminded her how much money she had spent and how she had left to spend from her Christmas money.

Yesterday I went to pay my internet bill as it was shut off when I got home work. My card declined and I checked my bank account to see that I only had $45. I reviewed my transactions thinking that it was me who overspent. I saw $400 in charges for Robux over a week. I cried. 

She understands how electronic payments work. She knows she was spending from my bank account and she says she just got carried away. 

I took away her phone, permanently, and explained that in a few years we’ll try again because she shown over the last few months that she’s not ready for it and spending all my money was the final straw. I looked through her phone history to see if I could piece anything together in the situation and saw that she reset my Apple ID password and was Googling how to add Robux to a group fund. Apparently she was providing Robux the group she created with her friends. 

After seeing how calculated she was in this, I also canceled her 10th birthday celebration next month. I planned on taking her a few friends out to dinner and some activities. 

From everything I understand about discipline and consequences, I feel like the situation should be done now and I should let it go because she’s already received her consequences but it doesn’t feel done. I’m so angry and hurt. And I’m angry at myself too. I’m having such a hard time because I know that it’s not healthy to give the silent treatment or anything like that but I’m having such a hard time because I don’t really want to talk to her. 

How can I handle this in a healthy way?",N/A,N/A

Second, sit down and talk to her about why this was so bad and hurtful and be honest about your emotions. 

Third..I wouldn’t completely cancel her 10th birthday being celebrated but there’s no way I’d include her friends. I’d do a cake and a card and a sorry you spent all the birthday money I had on your game.

Last thing I’d do is set up an allowance/chores sort of thing for her to help demonstrate the value of a dollar. 

I would also stop telling yourself she’s so emotionally mature bc at the end of the day she’s a kid and this is probably the first of many mistakes she’s going to make. Don’t make her the enemy or alienate her just as she’s going into the pre-pubescent and soon to be middle school years. 

She’s been through a lot with her change in home life, pandemic, etc. not to mention just being 9. 

I’d downgrade her to one of those little kid or old people phones that has no internet and just lets her call you or 911.

It seems our little lady is really smart. Her teacher said she's the best reader for her age she's literally ever known, by a long way. She's reading (silently to herself) for pleasure and can handle all the words thrown at her in general. She loves doing her maths for pleasure too and will write genuine stories (usually about princesses dying but hey...) for pleasure again. We'll just get presented with a 4 page book out of the blue, written with lovely handwriting etc.

Same time though, she LOVES TV, and found that her favourite thing is typically whatever comes up next on the YT Kids app on TV. This tends to be 12yr olds (and mid 30s women acting as if they're 12 yr olds) playing Minecraft and Roblox. She also likes a lady who paints old squishy toys, and also lots of colouring / drawing channels. Especially with the drawing she'll get pens and paper for herself and draw along, with lovely results. 

She used to love Ryan's World, but that and a few other ""Photogenic kids being exploited by their parents in a bizarrely empty and white house"" channels did quietly go on the block list.

She's just about to go to school as I type this. On school mornings she'll always have to eat, wash, dress before any TV at all, and when she does she always asks alexa to set a timer to go off after however she's told she can have... Weekends can be a bit more of a free-for-all though, as it's a good way for her to relax after a busy week of after school clubs etc.

So obviously... do you fellow parents think this is OK? There are (IMHO) good channels she likes, and other ones I feel are clearly awful. But then I'm some ancient dad who's just out of touch...? It feels like a shame she's watching poorly made, badly scripted clips rather than quality production values yet... eh... she likes it, and is clearly a bright shiny button of a kid.",N/A,N/A

This is because the app relies on creators to self report whether or not their videos are made for kids. They are not vetted at all and some, if not many, can contain inappropriate content for children. Some people even make videos where scary or sexual content is “hidden” in what looks to be a completely normal kids’  cartoon. 

Also, YouTube is not currently subject to regulatory laws around advertising to kids, so some of these creators push self promotion to the extreme. I’ve seen videos aimed at children where over half the video was self promotion. This can be very predatory on young children. 

My advice- don’t allow her to watch something on there unless you have seen it or are watching it with her. She may be a very bright little girl but even the smartest kids are still kids and easily manipulated by content creators who target them as their main audience.",j3vcpwh,N/A

My husband ran to see what was playing and it was a masked man sliding a bloody knife slowly against a hallway. So, we removed the app for them that moment,  and explained why.

But otherwise the video game steamers or weird YouTube personalities doing weird sensory projects are not allowed at all. We will look up videos together if we want to see something specific (like educational) and both kids can do exercise videos on YouTube. 

He plays more video games that I would like, and we are working on limiting that further. But at least video games involve thinking/problem solving etc rather than just watching. He generally struggles with independent creative play- he likes “closed ended tasks” like large puzzles, books, complex color by numbers, 500+ dot-to-dots, building lego sets, etc and plays great creatively with peers, so we are working on getting him more comfortable with independent creative play.

It's too new.  However, your post really comes of as ""my kid is just so smart and good that it's not possible for the content she likes to be bad"". I think it's obvious how illogical that assertion is.

Based on what I do know of child psychology and development when it comes to media, the biggest problem with these hours-long streams is that you just don't know what's going to pop up. There's an awful lot of bland cartoons on Disney+ and PBS Kids but I know what I'm getting when I put on one episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse for my kid when I'm making dinner. It's formulaic. I once was weak and put on a Blippi video about fire trucks while I did some bathroom cleaning and came back to that dude giggling about being ""a bad guy"" and how the police were going to arrest him and aren't handcuffs whacky, ahhh, ahhh, I can't get out of these shiiiiiiinyyyyyy handcuffs and he's going to put me in the back of the police car! Whoah! *creepy laugh* Like, just monumentally stupid pantomime of a man-child rolling out tire popping strips and exclaiming over how cool they are.

Look, imo, the drawing videos? Probably fine. Random ""content creators"" exclaiming over Stuff? Garbage. Watching people play video games? Would not trust the channels to stay safe even if it seems like a Nice Kid Playing Roblox. (Plus this is my old school talking but the whole ""watching people play video games for hours"" makes my skin crawl, and I say this as a gamer myself. I'd rather my kid pick up a tablet and play the games on the PBS kids app or explore Minecraft with my supervision then that nonsense.)

Me(41) and my wife (38) have two kids. AS girl aged nearly 12 and a boy of 10 years old. They both like playing computer games. Especially the boy who would prefer to do nothing else all day.

We've limited their screen time to an acceptable amount, but I'm kind of worried about the kind of games he likes to play. The games he's been spending most of his time with in the last few weeks have been what I'd call lootbox simulators.

Pet simulator on Roblox is the most recent one. I've watched him play some and the core gameplay loop is, click on a box so your pets will destroy/open it. Coins come out and you can used the coins to buy eggs from which you get better pets, rolled on a random loot table. And then you go on to the next area where the boxes require more effort (AKA Better pets) to be opened and the cycle repeats.

I've got the feeling/suspicion that this game is doing nothing else but feed a basic dopamine loop not unlike a Skinner box and I'm worried that this is unhealthy for him.

I'm aware that games have gotten easier over time. When computers made it in to my life when I was a tween games were pretty brutal by today's standards, but this 'game' doesn't seem to offer any kind of challenge, just the gambling aspect of getting a superior, more rare pet from the eggs that you buy with the ingame currency\*.

His sister plays the game as well sometimes, but most of the time when she plays Roblox she spends her time roleplaying/playing pretend. Though because she does play, it's turning the game in to a contest for her younger brother, making him want to play even more.

Should I do something to stop him playing these kinds of games so much? And if so, what would be a good way?

&#x200B;

\*: You can use premium currency to buy better eggs, but that's something we don't allow and our kids know how freemium games use this mechanic to lure people in to constantly spending money.

**Edit:** I forgot to mention, in all his other media habits, TV, youtube, books he really favors the short and to the point stuff like grizzly and the lemmings (which is basically a modern wiley e coyote cartoon), let's play youtubers who hype up their reactions and books like 13-storey treehouse.

- tell them, that roblox and other online games will be not allowed anymore, and that exceptions for certain games might be made in the future (i am thinking of more story based mmorpgs. I think things like starstable or world of warcraft are fine)
- let them know you understand that they are upset because it's immensely frustrating to get something taken away. Offer them a budget for offline games as an alternative.

Talking to your children about addiction, including gambling, can help set them up to be mindful of it. ""When the fun stops; stop!""

What you can also do, if there is a card tied to the account, change it to a prepaid £1 card or similair. If your child then tries to buy something they can't. Not saying they will, but having that safety net will help your peace of mind.",j4ukomj,j4uj11j

It was still the toy/play option, the thing was he didn't want to play alone. So, I would bring out the play doh and we would make things with that, did some nature walks around the neighborhood, got a baby pool and played around with the hose in the backyard, got some age appropriate games (Candyland, etc) to do together, puzzles, etc. Honestly, made me remember how much I loved it when I was little and my Dad would do any kind of activity with me, whether it was playing or mowing the lawn 😅 (Mom says I followed him like a duckling as soon as I could crawl)

In the words of my 3 yo ""Mama plays the best"" 😍😂

When I limited screen time for my son, there were huge battles, extreme distress and all he cared about is the next screen time. Everyone was miserable. 

Instead of taking it away, I just put a shut down timer for everything for bedtime but let it go otherwise. No limits on time. I restrict what he plays and watches (no online games and I seldom buy a new game for him, no unlimited access like YouTube- he has about 20 videos I've downloaded for him that I swap occasionally). And all fights and obsessive behavior stopped after a few months after he realized that the screen was no longer the big bad taboo. Now if I ask him to pause what he's doing because we need to do school/go to the store/brush our teeth/etc, he has no problems. In fact screens have lead to a lot of new interests, learning and related field trips.

My thinking is we live in a world jam packed with 24/7 access to screen based entertainment. How is he going to learn self regulation if I don't allow him to. What happens when he's 18? You really think he's going to move out and limit himself to 2 hours a day? Ha! I don't know many adults that can do that. No suddenly he is going to have a bazillion games, shows and apps he's never seen before and zero skills because he's had zero practice regulating and controlling his own screen time.

Of course I am still 100% on board with allowing screen time for the sake of your own sanity, but the best thing to replace screen time with is your attention.  

Screens may be the #1 most stimulating thing in their world, but playtime with mom or dad is a very close second.

When something is forbidden, kids seek it out so much more strongly. 

In reality, he will be surrounded by screens his entire life. If he doesn’t learn to self-regulate as a child, then he will not be set up for success as an adult.

How you approach this would vary from child to child, but I would start with the following:

1. Understand that not all screen time is the same. Watching an episode of a TV show is very passive/low value screen time. Playing a video game like Roblox, on the other hand, is a creative, social, and active pursuit. Given the choice, I would always encourage video games over YouTube or TV.

2. Start using more natural stopping points rather than timers. If you’re in the middle of an activity, it’s hard to stop just because the timer ran out. In video games, there are usually good stopping points (when it saves or when you complete a quest or whatever). So give a warning like “10 more minutes” and then around the 5 minute mark, say “find a good stopping point” or “wrap up what you’re doing”. This is not only more respectful to the child, but it teaches them to gauge how much time things take and to keep an eye on the clock.

It’s not easy to do these things, but if you give the child more control over their time, then they stop fighting you eventually. 

I only have my son as a frame of reference but we never timed his screen time and he is fully capable of stopping when asked. We don’t fight over this. Sometimes I might suggest that he takes a screen break and he understands that it’s important for his mental health. It’s not just because mean mom is saying it. He is very creative and very smart. He can spend hours working on a craft project or hours building something in a game and both are valuable ways of spending his time. 

His bff, on the other hand, has tightly controlled screen time and is always pushing the limits. He has gotten in trouble multiple times for figuring out how to get around the screen time limits on his iPad. His parents would definitely say that he has behavior problems because of the iPad, but I personally think the behavior problems are because of the very strict rules that are imposed on him.

Anyway, it’s my opinion and I understand most parents do not share it. Just wanted to provide an alternative view.",iqx1pqi,N/A

Now we do a family pizza/movie night once a week, and other than that they don’t get screens at all. It’s been very good, they’re much nicer and better behaved when they’re not watching screens, even as little as 30 min/day added a noticeable amount of behavioural issues.

If he’s closer to 4, I would yank his screen privileges entirely. But if he’s closer to 9, then I would say that screen time has to be earned. For each hour of fulfilling playtime, he gets 5-10 minutes of screen time, and he can cash it in once he accrues a half an hour minimum. At least, that’s what I’d do if I had a kid in a similar situation.

My parents actually didn’t allow me to have my own game system until I was in 4th grade (the cultural equivalent of tablets when I was that age). All I had at my avail was our family computer with games like Reader Rabbit and Jumpstart, and the TV, which I wasn’t a super avid watcher of anyway. I probably wouldn’t do the same with my own kids, as I felt that to be pretty draconian that I wasn’t allowed to bond with other kids my age over video games and felt pretty left out because of it, but I think there’s something to be said about severely limiting screen time. Myself and my friend who had a similar situation retained our ability to actually PLAY a lot longer than our peers, at least from what I saw. While other kids just chatted idly on the playground in fifth grade (when we met), we still had our own fictional worlds we played in. Didn’t matter if we’d brought any toys that day or not… we still had the ability to have fun with our imaginations. That’s something I really value when it comes to kids is the ability to play. I don’t want my future kids to end up like my younger cousin, who at age 8 or so said that she didn’t know how to play (I was trying to get me to join in playing with her little brother) because she was into more “adult” things like Disney Channel shows.

It really started during COVID when all school was done on an iPad. I had to work 70+hours a week at odd hours for two years and my poor partner was so burnt out from being home with him the majority of the time that most screen time regulation went out the window. 

What we do now is once we're all home, and after he's taken care of his responsibilities for the day (showering, putting his toys away, etc), we ask him how much screen time he feels like he's earned. 

Days like today where he got up, got ready, had a good day at school, helped me with dinner without me even asking, and did his night time routine we usually give him an hour. If behavioral issues come up, it decreases the time he's earned. 

I bought a Nintendo Switch so we could play games together which he enjoys so that's also an incentive for him.

in general tablet time is called ""computer time"" and its twice a week or on weekends only. tv is only an after school treat and theres a morning blackput for tv except on the weekend.  because its computer time i encourage him to sit at a table with it, instead of reclining with it like its a friend or source of comfort. if anything its a challenge since he only plays games on it.

its all regulated withan eye for any shows that seem to not allow him to interact w the world or make him obsessive. this means no youtube, only episodes of shows on netflix or pbskids. the short clips and hapzard algorithm is part of the addictive cycle.

I have a child that *really* enjoys his screen time so we have to be very careful with how we manage it. 

First off, max 1 hour per day. Any more is way too much. 
Second, screen timenis an earned privilege. Do your homework, do your chores, clean up after yourself, etc. 
Third, screen time includes TV. If it includes a screen, it is screen time. 
Fourth, all usable devices are completely controlled by patents. We can turn off the wifi, or use an app on our phone that locks when screen time is up. 
Fifth, when screen time is up, it's up. No more. Don't even ask. 
Sixth, your behavior when you stop screen time affects your time for the next day. So if you whine and complain unendingly, and ask for more time, you won't get it the next day. 
Seventh, a sleepover is not an excuse foe screen time binging. We require sleep at a sleepover. You can't have screen time until 4 on the morning.",iqwbu8b,N/A

If you put a pw on it, he'll lock the screen and have you unlock it all the time. It'll drive you mad. Eventually he'll see you type the password too. 

It's rough because it's a great babysitter haha. 

This doesn't make you a bad parent. People have been using TV for years. Now the TV comes with you.

Long story short, my son self weened. It gave him a very unique behavior though. He's super cool and chill. He also has no problem making friends (girls and guys). He still quotes some of the videos. And still a very kind boy.

Children need routine and expectations. Tell your child that screen time is at a certain time of day (if your schedule changes often, you can even say it's ""after lunch"" or something of the sort). Once it's screen time, kid gets to go on the screen and a timer goes up. We have a Google Home and our children can read clocks, so they can check how long is left of screen time. Once that timer goes, all screens come off until the next day. The first couple of days might be a bit tantrumy but they very quickly get the hang of it.",iqwcie7,N/A

Age is another consideration, if the kid was a few years older, personally I wouldn't do anything about it. But a 7 year old? They should have a limit.  


Cold turkey, but for the future, it's a good idea to be a lot more lenient when they get to the 12-13 age range.   


This bit is on a more personal note, and does not apply to everyone, but excessive screen time when i was younger not only has given me a bit more time to have fun, but has also taught me seven programming languages, and has given me full mastery over most Windows, OS X, and Linux based operating systems. A few extra hours a day has built up my entire future. I feel like most parents view screens as ""the spawn of Satan"", when they can be a valuable tool for their kid.

I was actually livid when he gave our child one.  We argued about it because he thought an IPad with educational apps was educational.  I argued it was straight up screen time.

Then at one point we took screen time away for an entire week as punishment and I noticed a huge improvement in our child’s behavior.  Our child also has Sensory Processing Disorder, so she’s not quite neurotypical.  

With no screen time, she was less irritable, less belligerent and less tired.  Initially, we capped screen time to 2 hours a day.  Now, it’s 30 minutes a day Sunday-Friday and ONLY after all her homework is completed, chores are done and her room picked up.  Saturday we let her have a free for all, but I’d probably say she gets no more than 4 hours that day (basically a couple hours of free use and we watch a family movie at night).  Not to mention, there’s screen time during instructional time at school.  More teachers are incorporating screen time in class with videos, electronic whiteboards, etc.  Studies have shown what screen time does to developing brains and we don’t need that.  I also think that this differs from child to child.  Mine can’t handle much screen time, but I look at one of my nephews who is on his IPad more often and he seems able to handle a couple hours a day just fine.

She has an extracurricular activity that lasts 30 min-6 hours daily (daddy-daughter day on Saturdays include going out to breakfast, soccer, lunch with dad, maybe some errands and hitting the park/bowling/arcade).  These help a ton with our kid.  Almost all other activities are activities of her choosing so she gets to engage in activities she enjoys like soccer and music.  She truly enjoys all her extracurriculars and has even asked for more because I sign her up for whatever classes she’s interested in and I’d much rather engage in her interests which don’t revolve around screen time.  All her extracurriculars also include other children, so there’s also the added benefit of socializing.  My kid is an only child and lockdown/virtual school along with required masking at school did nothing to help her socially.  She’s behind on reading social cues, so the regular interfacing with peers has been really helpful in getting her caught up.

That’s what we do in our home.",ir0gfyh,N/A

I downloaded Kidslox onto it, so I could monitor what he was watching and implement time limitations. I set up parent controls and passwords on the computer as well. In the kids YouTube app, I went in and changed settings to allow him to be only watch pre-approved videos. The two hours a day was never enough for him. It really felt like we’d just argue about it forever. It got somewhat easier when we put him into preschool, and better still when we signed him up for jujitsu- he was home less so there was naturally less screen time. But it was still hard during the transition when screen time was over. And being “bored” was a frequent complaint.

But the last few months he just doesn’t seem to care about screen time. It’s been amazing! He engages much more with creative play, and will choose activities other than screen time, even when it’s available. He’d rather listen to a podcast and play with legos or take the dog outside and pretend he’s a wizard with a stick for a staff. I think after two years of owning the iPad, he finally figured out that it’s simply not that cool, and got better at finding other things to do. 

We try to go camping a few times in the summer, which has also served as a screen time detox (for him and for us). As parents, we have also tried to be off our phones more. I have made an effort to find my own quiet hobbies that doesn’t require a screen, and try to refrain from using my phone during times that he is not allowed to use one either. Model and support the thing you’re asking of them. I also try to get us out of the house on weekends, with at least one child-centered fun outings a week.

I think there are a lot of people on the side of “more restrictions on screen time the better.” But really, they’re a lifesaver in a lot of situations. They’re also here to stay, so we have to teach them how to use them responsibly. Ultimately, the bigger issue is that he’s struggling with some life skills: (1) transitions to a less ideal task, and (2) creatively entertaining/problem solving for himself. I think it’s be better to focus on building those skill sets, trust that it will get better, and be patient and consistent with the boundaries in the meantime. He’ll figure it out eventually - hopefully it won’t take him two years, like it did with ours! 😉",ir0nf9e,N/A

re cars: not to be gendered but my sons car thing seems to be a way for him to communicate or play with new kids or himself in a way where verbal skills arent the crux of play. that said we had to use the cars to encourage pretend play and social play. he still uses them as comfort objects but he can also play w dolls/figurines/dinisaurs in an imaginative way so the car play is more balanced.  i notice little girls his age are often way beyond him verbally and engage is much more complex social play. consider what the games may be standing in for. he may want a challenge or a hobby to be focused on, or a way to move his hands and eyes.",ir0o98n,iqzilu5

And you can’t waiver: screen is done in 5 minutes means just that, no matter his reaction. And you can even leverage his reaction as a condition for additional screen time the following day.

It’s HARD. My daughter is an only child and lousy at being self entertained. If her daily show allotment expires in the middle of me doing something, it is so tempting to just be like, “Fine, five more minutes…” so I can finish what I’m doing. However, when I did that, I found it was a super slippery slope. Now, limits are hard and final.",iqwwbos,iqwnkp3

""He has no excuse not to play with them"" sounds a bit harsh - I think you can only encourage play, never guilt someone into it.

They are little people just like you and me. Yes they require direction but at the end of the day try to put yourself into his shoes. Would you like it if people told you what to do in your freetime? Suggestions are welcome but you probably wouldn't appreciate it if someone guilted
you into watching a movie you don't actually want to watch.

Same with co-play vs solo play. You, as an adult, could book yourself the most amazing vacation - but I believe for the majority of people, they wouldn't enjoy it by themselves. And if you do it's provably because you'd meet people wherever you go.

The little ones are just a social as we adults and prefer company.

And now my most important point: You can NEVER have enough Lego! lol - I would build entire cities with trains and streets growing up. (Doesn't even have to be specific Lego - just generic) - I attribute a lot of my creativity to being able to build things I've seen during the day - For example, I would built rides etc after a trip to the fair with my parents. Creativity can develop greatly during solo plat as others have statet - but it helps to ""induce"" some help :)",ir09qlu,iqzlqf8

The American Pediatric Association recommends 1 hour or less per day. Our oldest is 5, so the kindergarten homework is mostly: read some books together, or practice writing words together-- admittedly not very screen intensive.

This is an interesting talk by doctor Victoria Dunkley on screen time and behavior disturbance in children, which is her area of practice/ research: https://www.parentmap.com/pm-live-wired-and-tired-screen-time-and-behavior-disturbance-children

She believes all screen time is the same, in terms of how it stimulates the brain, regardless of content. The more interactive the screen is, according to her research, the more likely it is to over stimulate and trigger addictive behaviors. 

In prior iterations of our household approach, we thought about screen time based on content-- i.e., ABC mouse is fine, PBS kids is fine; Octonauts is a treat or reward or a Sunday distraction while we do some house cleaning. We've since revised our approach, and are treating all screen stuff as the same.",ir01hq0,iqzod5t

Second, I wonder if he's suffering from too much choice--if you have a lot of toys around, it can be hard for a kid to choose. If this is the case, put some of them away. If it isn't, just let him sit there with the toys he has and wait until he gets bored enough to play.

We all get dopamine from devices. Does he have enough positive attention or mostly criticism? Does he feel loved and cared about? Sometimes we get into a habit of being army Sargent and just telling our kids what to do and what they are doing wrong.  As well as firmly reducing screen time or taking it away for a period, I'd be looking at what makes him happy (aside from screens). 

Also consider your own screen use and also your husband needs to be firmer. Agreeing extra time with your kid was not good - he thinks you or your husband can be persuaded. 

With taking devices when you are sleeping, put them where he can't get them. He is actually winning against you both by outwitting you. This will only are him miserable as you are meant to be in charge. It makes him always look for a way around you. Be smarter than your kid.",iqz0u6s,iqxq1b9

My daughter is 10 and will be 11 this summer, entering 6th grade (middle school) next year. She has an iPad at home and we allow her access to technology and social media, so she can already call/text friends, see TikTok, play Roblox, etc.

This strategy has proven to be great thus far because she always comes to us to ask questions, work through a hurtful or rude situation with friends, ask what certain things mean. Having the chance to have a conversation and teach her etiquette and social coping skills for the tech part of her life feels important in helping her navigate it at a later age, when stakes are higher and parents are not as involved.

This being said, she is one of a very few 5th graders who doesn’t have a phone. Most had them in 3rd and 4th grade. I’m not sure why this feels like a big next step but it does. Phones seem like a huge potential distraction at school, cameras, texts, etc. can turn inappropriate when a group of peers and no parental supervision is inconvenient (ie, the bus). We are considering it for next school year when she enters 6th grade.

According to my stepdaughter, they are supposed to keep their phones off during the day and in their book bag in their cubby. If the teacher hears the phone going off and they are caught using it outside of lunch and recess and after school they get in some sort of trouble.

I have four boys; 5, 8, 10 and 14. Truth be told, only my 14 year old has a couple of buddies he hangs out with somewhat regularly. We’ve never had a sleepover at our house, my three youngest have never really gone to other kids’ houses or had friends over. Dad and I are introverts and we’ve had a really hard time connecting with parents, even when our kids were attending public school. Now that we’re doing online learning, I can tell my kids are starved for companionship, and I feel like a failure as a mom. My ten year old, especially. He has one friend he met through online school that he talks to everyday, but she lives two hours away (we made the trip to visit her a couple weeks ago and it was awesome). He’s got self-esteem issues, and I think it makes him reluctant to the idea of making new friends. I don’t know what to do to get him connected with kids with similar interests: video games (specifically Roblox) and Warriors (the cat kind). I’ve tried looking for clubs in our area but am coming up empty-handed. We did some Warrior outschool classes over the summer which were fun, but he needs his people, not just over the internet. 

I’m filled with guilt that I didn’t make more of an effort to reach out to parents to set up play dates or whatever. I don’t want my kids to look back and feel like a huge chunk of their childhood is missing. My kids are really well-adjusted in general, we just need to figure out how to get them to make friends.

I’ve joined a bunch of homeschool Facebook groups in my area, and have gotten on waiting lists for some relevant library classes for them. But I want to do more. Any advice or guidance would be deeply appreciated.

TL;DR: my kids don’t really have friends, and now that we’re doing online learning, I don’t know how to get them socialized. Help?",N/A,N/A

1. Talk to your daughter about internet safety and etiquette in general .

2. Have an honest conversation about predators. The internet is like being at an amusement park. You may 5alk to the person in li e next to you but you do not give them identifiable information.

3. Get the user name of the person talking to her on roblox. Contact roblox and request that this account and all future accounts created by this person be blocked from accessing your daughter.  Also let them know you suspect it is a predator. If parents and kids don't report, the company doesn't know.

4. Find out what she enjoys about roblox. Minecraft is similar but from what my students tell me safer.

5. Start building an open relationship with your daughter. She needs to know she can tell you about her life without judgment or punishment. 

6. Leave her in school. You can not control her actions, she is an individual with her own thoughts and feelings.  If you pull her out of school, most likely she will resent you.

Come at the conversation with immense compassion, try to start with several ways you see their point and THEN see if you can bring up why you’re concerned and see if they’d like to dialogue with you solutions that feel safe.

Home-schooling is hard work and you need to do it for the right reasons. If you do it just to shelter her from outside influences, you will do her a huge disservice. You won't be able to keep her safe from the world, at least not forever, and you need to come to terms with that. One day, she'll leave your home and enter the real world. If you never expose her to anything risky or dangerous until then, she'll be completely screwed, because she'll have no idea what's out there and can't protect herself. 

Instead of trying to control her in this way, prepare her for these dangers and teach her how to keep herself safe. Kids don't grow an extra part of their brain, which contains all the knowledge on how to handle the world and take care of themselves, the night of their 18th birthday. These are skills that need to be taught and practiced for years and years and years, and sheltering her is the exact opposite of what you need to do to teach her these skills. 

Sit down with her and go over the chat with her. Explain what concerns you about it. For example that he only told her his age after your daughter already told him she's 11. Explain that there are predators out there who mask themselves as kids in order to try and gain kids' affection so that they can sexually exploit them. Tell her that some people use being suicidal as emotional blackmail, so that you do what they want because you're scared of hurting them so much that they end up hurting themselves. Tell her that even if someone is genuinely suicidal, she shouldn't do things she's not comfortable with, and that if a suicidal person does end up hurting themselves, it's never her fault. Explain that some predators specifically use Roblox to target kids because they know that a lot of the players are 8-12 year olds. Etc. Have the entire internet safety talk with her (not telling anyone her name or where she lives, not posting pictures of herself or that could identify the area she lives in, not giving random internet strangers her number or address, etc). 

Ultimately, you can't keep her safe by controlling her. Maybe you can do it temporarily, but in the long run, it'll end up doing a lot more harm than good. Teach her how to keep herself safe. You need to focus on raising a future adult.",hoe1aks,N/A

I’m curious everyone’s opinion on screen time and tantrums/acting out.  

Lately I’ve noticed my just-turned-5y/o has been acting terrible and throwing tantrums and being all around nasty/mean towards her little brother which she’s never done before.

I’ve heard from some people who cut out screen time for a couple weeks how their kids attitudes totally change but with 3 kids (one of which is a newborn) it’s kind of our crutch. We’ve cut it down already and will usually just watch a bit in the morning and then to wind down at night and then she plays Roblox for an hour (we cut that way down too) but the attitudes just keep getting worse…

Just as a P.S. we’ve been trying to watch how we speak and I’ve tried talking to her about it but nothing seems to help. Also I do monitor what they watch very closely, no tv on a phone or tablet it’s always on our living room tv so I know what they’re watching at all times.",N/A,N/A

They had tablets and were a nuisance as one had a game the other didn't have, so they'd argue over it to the point we'd have to intervene and take tablets away. Once we realised they were just watching stuff on it, we accidentally, on purpose, forgot to charge them, and we are almost 2 months now without them.

Now the worst is YouTube! It stopped almost instantly in our house. They literally wouldn't move! They'd piss and crap themselves and be completely hypnotised by it! They'd go in a total meltdown if we even threatened to turn it off! They aren't allowed to watch it anymore, and we've had to warn the grandparents about it as last week both sets let them watch YouTube, and their behaviour afterwards wasn't great.

We don't mind them watching netflix and spending the day with the TV because by the end of the week, they are burnt out. But we do watch their screen time, we don't put the TV on anymore when they get back from school and it's only them that will turn it on and it's a rarity",j3xzv91,N/A

I overheard our fourth-born excitedly telling his older sibling that someone just gave him all these Robux. I stepped in, and asked done questions- no, he didn't know the person, yes it was totally free- about $15 worth. 
We then had a talk (again) about how one should NEVER accept any gifts from strangers, or reveal personal information, etc.  

This has never been an issue with his older siblings, however I could see his eyes glaze over during our talk- the cost-benefit equation was just too skewed towards him (I think) in his brain that there will be very little incentive for him NOT to engage in something like this again. His world has just been too safe- not exactly sheltered, but he's never really seen or experienced real danger.

I'm not sure where to go with this...

Edit: we've had many conversations about internet safety, about nothing is ever free, but he has always been our...(greediest sounds mean, but...) child. He just doesn't think too deeply if there's something immediately in it for him.",N/A,N/A

If it's small and there's no request for something in return, what harm is this specific instance really doing?

I played MMOs throughout my teens. Sometimes people give out free things, it's not that weird. My children received Robux gift cards once from grandma and one requested to buy her online friend an item that didn't cost very much, it was entirely her idea (friend didn't ask her to do it) so I okayed it.

One gift leads to another which leads to another which leads to all kinds of surprise strings being attached. The kid then feels obligated to do what the gift giver asks.

So I wrapped boxes of rocks and seashells to make it look like he had more presents to open. After the prior year's ""coal"" gift, he assumed the rocks were edible and tried to eat them.

We relented this October and got him the headset/mic for his birthday for his (my) Xbox.  I figured it would be a good way for him to be social with other kids.  I only allow him to play age-appropriate games, and I made him sign a written contract like a lunatic the day he got these.  It was a basic contract that he read and understood, including to not use adult language, not to talk to anyone much older than him, and and I reserve the right at any time to take it away if the rules aren't respected.  I had full confidence in him because I know he's a good kid.

He has respected the rules and not broken the contract.  But he doesn't STFU!!!  He's talking to kids non-stop in the hour he is allowed to play.  He lost two friends today because they were probably so freaking annoyed from him talking at them for an hour straight.

If your son or daughter has complained that some friend online won't STFU, that was my kid, sorry.  When he was little, he didn't speak much and we wondered if he would ever talk.  Now it's just constant, absolutely relentless talking.  I know I will miss this one day, but christ man aren't you thirsty for talking for an hour straight like that?  Anyway I'm sorry.",N/A,N/A

That said, don’t feel guilty if you want to say something about it. It’s actually not a bad thing to let your kiddos know if you need some quiet time or changes in topic from time to time. 

Teaching kids to have empathy for others is a great life skill for not only at home but for social normals with others - no one would want to listen about how pink sparkly shoes are the best shoes in the world for hours, right? (Sorry, it’s a weird, random example but hang in there with me).  

Or maybe it’s been a long/ bad day and you’re just not in a mental state where you can hear one more freaking random fact about minecraft without wanting to pull your hair out, despite all the love you have for your child and not wanting to crush their soul/spirit/willingness to share with you in the future.

BUT the REALLY important part in teaching these lessons is that you 

- DON’T tell them / teach this lesson when they are in the middle of sharing otherwise you risk hurting your child and making them feel unconfident in wanting to share with you again in the future.

- DO share with them how much you love that they are excited and happy about the topics they bring up. That it’s awesome to share with people you love and you know care about you .

- DO listen when they share, even when it’s not a topic you really care about. It’s important to them and it’s the same way you would want to be treated when talking to a friend, right?  

- DO give them time to talk and after actively listening and asking engaging questions, go ahead and change subjects to let your child know it’s time for something new to talk about. If they don’t get it, you can always say “It was really fun to hear about your Minecraft Story today but I would also LOVE to hear about ....” 

- DO share and talk about things you like or are excited about with your child too!  It’s a great way for them to learn about being good listeners and getting an understanding of how healthy conversations work. (Keep in mind of your audience and where they are at developmentally though when bringing up your topics - you might have to talk in excited tones and include/exclude different facts when talking to a five year old but for a teenager you could have a less animated and more factual discussion.)

- DO tell your kids when you are having a rough time or are in need of a break and try to tell them in advance so you can avoid hurt feelings. 
Example I’ve told my kids: “Hey, I love you guys! I just want to give you the head’s up that mom here has had a bit of a rough day. I would be super grateful if we could talk and share things later when I know I’m not in a grumpy mood and I can give you the my best listening ears and attention that you deserve.“ 


Bottom line, it’s nice to have our children share with us but it’s also good to have boundaries and to also acknowledge needs and feelings of everyone.",gc177ba,N/A

I'm on the phone with a freaking client talking about stuff and I have to ask him to hold briefly so I can a) tell my son to be quiet, b) tell him to stop micromanaging, c) stop bossing people around.

The parental controls do work on the Xbox as far as the inability to play mature games.  But there is no way I can control what is said.  What I've heard is 95% fine.  There's 5% that's 9 year olds talking about what 9 year olds talk about.  

I think, and I'm sure you have too, if you instill in them what makes good choices, there won't be too much of a problem other than possibly too much playing time once in a while on the DL.  Friday nights I give him a pass.  He can play from after dinner till 930.",gc08gyp,gc05e5n

The title says it. We live in Florida and the school was cancelled because the hurricane Ian was coming. My wife was at work and I was staying home with our kids 3(f) and 7(m). I put my daughter down for her nap and my son was playing Roblox on his phone ( I know I know). 
I started getting the place ready for the hurricane by ""nailing"" down anything that can fly and getting all of the garbage together to dispose of it. 
Now, we live in an apartment community and the garbage disposal is a 2 minute walk from our building. It's not a rare occasion that you would see cars with garbage bags on their hood driving by because the disposal is next to the entrance/exit of the community.
When I got all of the garbage/boxes together I asked my son if he wants to walk with me or to stay home. He chose to stay in. Not the the first time, although, up to about 6 months ago he was very apprehensive of staying home alone and would always chose the tagging along option.
So off I went and was gone for about 7 to 8 minutes. On a way back I get a phone call from him. His phone is fully functional and he has his own number.  He uses it to video chat with grandparents in NY or call mom at work (I work from home) and use mobile internet during trips. Before I could answer the phone call dropped. I called him back but the line was busy. 
I knew something was up so I ran home. It took me about 30 seconds after his call to get there.  When I made it, he was in tears and on a phone with someone, who, I was pretty sure, was my wife. 
He saw me walking in, said to whoever it was  that everything is fine now, bye and hung up. 
I asked him what happened and he said he thought I was missing. He said he needs to tell me something. I said sure. He said I thought it was an emergency and called 911. Sure enough his phone started ringing and it was a local police department calling back to make sure we are fine. The lady said she received a phone call from a child stating that his father was missing. I assured her that everything is fine indeed and I was only gone for 8 minutes taking a garbage out prior to hurricane hitting the area.
She said thank you for confirming and that was the end of it. 
But.. My son was in so much stress. He thought the police will come and take him away from us and place him with foster parents (his best friend's parents are going through a really bad divorce, that's where he gets his info from). I did my best to convince him it is not going to happen unless he will continue calling the police every time I'm gone for less than 10 minutes. Obviously, I'm not going to leave him home alone again, even if he begs me to. 
We had a long conversation about what real emergencies are and when it's a good call to get the police involved. 
He was shaken for about 40 minutes or so after it happened and then went to his usual self. He brought it up again when my wife came home and we went through what the emergency situations are again. 
He truly believed it was an emergency and I was lost or something, that is why he made a call.

I blame Roblox:)). He might have lost the track of time playing his rainbow friends game.

For context - we never left our kids home alone. Not a single time. Cleaning outside or walking a dog, if they don't want to join but can still see us,  is the only time when they are inside by ""themselves"". 

Anyway, I would love if you could share similar incidents and how you handled them. 


Tldr: My kid called the police while I was taking the garbage out and he thought I was gone missing. It all happened within 8 minutes span.

Ps. I see that some of you have different opinion whether or not my son should have a fully functional phone. I want to make it clear that I see no harm in him using his phone and play some games on it. He gets about an hour of game time per day. He may still use his phone for other tasks, like reading, math, drawing etc.
All of it is easily controlled through parents app and phone settings. 
When I said I was blaming Roblox for what happened - I was making a joke.
I'm not taking his phone away from him.

Well, I had never moved before (I was probably around the same age as your son, actually!) and didn’t realize how long this took, especially with them needing to catch an elevator for every trip. In my child mind, I thought “oh my God, my parents have gone missing” and my sister and I looked out the window to find them — nowhere to be seen. Freaked out, we paused our movie and hopped in the elevator to go down to the lobby to search for our parents. My parents didn’t see us in the condo and we all essentially went up and down the elevators, missing each other each time, and I genuinely thought my parents either disappeared or left us for good.

Child knowing how to call 911and having access to a phone is an awesome thing and does save people's lives. Your child did his best for you with the information he thought he had. Before cellphones, kids of all ages had access to phones in every home and also called 911. Him having a phone is not the issue.

Second, my own freaking phone called 911 when I was on a walk. My lock screen was on. My phone was on silent because it almost always is. My phone called 911 from the emergency screen and all they heard was rustling and heavy breathing. They called and called me back several times. We live in the country and I don't know how fast gps works but they were starting the process to try to find where the call came from. When I took out my phone to look at the time I realized my phone was ringing and I answered, the 911 operator was so happy it was a butt dial and not someone being attacked. Mistakes happen. I felt awful.

I had always seen people using the phone and I wanted to try I knew about calling 999 so I called them to chat. My mum was legitimately gone for like 3 minutes and she came back to me on the phone with the police. The police sent an officer round to chat to me about what he does etc. oh and that I should come say hi in person that way we can catch up instead of on the phone but if it’s an emergency I should call. Apparently it worked I wasn’t scared to talk to the police and never called them again,iqq7f7k,N/A

The reason I ask, is that some intuitive kind things that any parent might do to soothe and reassure such a child can actually accidentally make things worse :/ This book is worth reading on the topic: *Anxiety Relief for Kids: On-the-Spot Strategies to Help Your Child Overcome Worry, Panic, and Avoidance* by Bridget Flynn Walker, PhD.

My kids are still pretty young. 6 and 3. So I know this doesn’t really apply right now but my husband and I have started talking more about what internet use is going to look like in the next few years for our kids. 

I know things are different now than they were when I was younger in the early 2000s. But I spent a ton of time online starting at age 12. A lot of it was innocent. Talking to friends I knew irl on aim and msn messenger and playing neopets. But it quickly turned into going to online forums and posting things and going to teen chat rooms and talking with strangers. I was smart about it. I never gave my real name or location. I mostly just lied a ton. It was sort of a creative outlet for me I suppose. And I actually made some real friends (even though I was pretending to be someone else) who I never met in real life but still looked forward to chatting with daily. 

It got me thinking about how I still talk to strangers online frequently. Through Reddit posts or Facebook groups. I’ve made some really good friends through my Reddit turned Facebook due date group. As someone with a lot of social anxiety, finding people online to connect with has been a big part of my life. And while I know things are very different now, I’m wondering at what point do I allow my kids to form those types of friendships?

I know there is so much scary stuff happening online these days. And I’m scared of that too. But I also know it’s impossible to avoid the internet and I wonder if there is a balance somewhere? I know I was scared of sharing personal info or pictures with strangers but I know my kids may not feel that way. Any advice?",N/A,N/A

We as kids joined the online world later because lack of technology and the internet was very very different than it is today.

Too many kids start using social media practically as soon as they can spell words without any supervision or any guidance or any instruction. If the kid can understand never to send pictures without asking their parents never to give the hometown or the name of the school or their last name or anything like that they can probably handle it. I would say the average eight or nine year old can remember those rules. But you have to teach them the rules you have to display the rules you have to spend some time with them on social media as a team to give them the hang of how it all works,j6n56i6,N/A

This is the reason why there are so many games on the platform. There’s a lot of new games being added frequently.  Game creators can add in game purchases (purchased with Robux) which can be special features like unlimited in game currency, special boosts like being able to jump higher, unlock special packs, etc. It’s not necessary to buy these, sometimes it makes the game faster and easier.

There are many different types of games in Roblox.

My family enjoys the “tycoon” games. Where you earn “money” or whatever you’re collecting in the game and build your “base” or whatever you’re building in the game. There’s zoo tycoons (building and customizing your own zoo), Pizza restaurant tycoon, store tycoon, mall tycoon, etc. 

Since there are a lot of games that are NOT appropriate for little kids, it’s best to monitor them and even play with them. We’ve been playing it for a few years and LO only plays on Roblox when we’re playing with them. They’re also only allowed to play games that we have played ourselves and added to their favorite list so we know it’s appropriate. 

To name a few of our favorite games:

like Work at a Pizza Place, which allows you to earn money by “working” in various positions in a pizza restaurant, and you can buy furniture for your home in game, make your house bigger, buy clothes and accessories in that game. 

Club Roblox is a roleplaying game where it’s a city, you have your own house (that you can customize, upgrade, change), work in different buildings, roleplay in other careers like hospital, police station, daycare,etc. 

Build a boat for treasure is where you build a boat using blocks and if you can pass the course at the end there is a treasure chest where you can earn coins and new building materials. 

There’s a firefighter game (not sure what it was called) is great for little kids because you get to drive around the city in the firetruck and put out fires. 

Bee swarm simulator is a game where you collect pollen from flowers, take it to your hive where your bees make honey, and you use the honey as “money” to unlock more bees, bee hive spots, and to upgrade your tools.

There’s also shooting games (for older kids and adults)… we don’t play those. but there is a game called Big Paintball that we play sometimes which is just 2 teams (blue vs red) trying to get the other team. My husband found a game like Rust that he enjoys playing as well. 

There’s a whole bunch of different kinds of games that’s good for little kids and it’s fun for parents to play with their kids too. If you play it with little kids you can set their profile to their age and it won’t show inappropriate words in the chat for kids under (13 I think?) which is based on the age on their profile. You can also turn off the chat to prevent kids from seeing any chat at all (from other players) and it also prevents them from being able to chat. There’s even an account restriction which only allows curated content, from what I’ve seen from using this though, there are some games (like Work at a Pizza place) that aren’t allowed. I think you can still see all the games but it will only allow you to play specific games.",hjkc2mx,N/A

So I have a 4 yr old girl. She has always slept next to me and my bf’s bed since she was born. Her crib then now bed has always been next to us just b/c of living arrangements in his parents house. They refurbished the basement where is now an open area. With the stairs split in the middle. We took one side and made the other area for her, like her own little bedroom where she has her clothes, kitchen set and other toys. She didn’t like the idea of sleeping away from us but I’d figure now is the time for her to learn to sleep on our own, without us right next to her. The problem now is, around I’d say 4 or 5 months ago we have started noticing every single sound scares her. And I mean every single sound. He doesn’t like the dark, needs to see every thing and needs to know what every single noise is. I think it’s due to my bf’s mom no regulating what she watching on her phone (my daughter does have her own iPad, but goes for her phone more because she knows she can do whatever she wants on it. She plays Roblox and watches YouTube clips of whatever is on it. We have tried to tell his mom, she needs to regulate what she’s doing on her phone but she doesn’t quite care. She is who watches her while both of us work during the day. ) i think Roblox has basically made her scared of noises because of all the scary games there are on it. I refuse to have her sleep on our bed because she needs to learn to sleep in her own bed. There has been nights where I have just given in because we’ve just been so exhausted. There was a night where we both called out of work because we got 0 sleep. I honestly don’t know what to do or how to approach this or how to fix it. I’ve recently started giving her kids melatonin to ease her into sleep but she still manages to wake up and not go back to bed easily. So any advice or experience is kindly appreciated for this sleep deprived (in the 3rd trimester) mom",N/A,N/A

And make it something fun between the two of you as well. My grandpa and I bonded over video games. He would play them and show me whatever he was playing when I came over. It’s one of my best childhood memories (even if the games were maybe a bit inappropriate haha but it never bothered me) and I think it’s why I still love video games today. I have been so excited to do the same thing with my kids. 

So far, they really love any games we share. My oldest and I played Sword and Shield together (she was 6-7 at the time) and she loved meeting up to battle the bigger Pokémon together. And just sharing how far we had gotten, tips for beating gyms, stuff like that. 

My youngest (currently 6) loves playing Mario Party or Big Brain Academy together. Or any game she sees me or her sister interested in. She just wants to be included. 

I don’t usually do the hard parts for them. I do occasionally make exceptions, like my youngest for some reason gets anxious about playing Bowser’s Big Blast in Mario Party so I just pick the color for her. 

I don’t make them keep going in a game if they want to quit. We have so many games that they jump around and always come back to the hard game eventually, so I don’t feel the need to force it. I take breaks from games when I get frustrated and come back to it, so I don’t see this an a bad thing.

I started letting her play my completed games, mainly pokemon. That way she could run around all she wanted to get used to the controls and there weren't any trainers to impede her. And my pokemon were strong enough to knock out any wild ones she would run into. She moved onto Kirby and Mario, I think side scrollers are a perfect place to start.

For the most part I encourage her to do it, unless I know it was an especially tricky bit, then I would do it for her.

She's 8 now and does amazingly well, better than I was as a kid (all I played back in the day was Pokemon, so I never had to learn to control a camera for example.) We're a gaming family so it's our main bonding activity between all 3 of us. We all play FFXIV together now.",ix3larf,N/A

We started him on old Nintendo games like Mario 1 and 2. Then when he was 4 and a half we got a family switch with Mariokart which kept him and us entertained for months. I installed the switch parental control app on my phone so he can only play for an hour a day during the week and 1.5 hours on the weekends. Exceptions if it's family playing together- right now all three of us are playing through an old Marvel game so we do an extra hour if he wants. I've got a vague balance running in my head of hours of physical exercise outdoors = hours of screen time. When he gets super frustrated we generally just encourage him to keep trying, and talk him through the steps- the sense of accomplishment he gets when he manages something is worth it. 

We borrow switch games from our local libraries, and I'd really recommend it. 2 weeks gives you long enough to figure out if your kid likes a game enough to put it on a birthday or Chriatmas list. Especially for branded stuff that my son would normally jump at like Paw Patrol - after a few days he'll be like ""This game is boring"" and that's 50 bucks saved.",ix412wg,N/A

That's one of the benefits of video games; they teach problem solving skills and how to deal with disappointment/failure.

It's a fun intro to RPG style games and has a good story. What was nice is that there is a little assistant called Igniculus that follows you around that is used mainly for puzzles with some limited involvement in the turn based combat. Igniculus can be controlled by a second player so this was a nice lower stakes way to get her familiar with a game controller and basic movements l. She loved the game abd we have played it through about 3.5 times. She is now almost 7 and still asks to play even though I'm a bit sick of it lol.

Eta on the subject of letting them fail or helping, I think it's a balance. I would say it's a good way to let them learn from failure and how to practice to improve on something.

They were each around 3-4ish when they started, now theyre 4.5 and 6. The first one is obviously the best for them since the first level the bad guys don't hardly attack back, and then they progressively get more aggressive. It took awhile for them to do more than the first few worlds (when the bad guys actually attack first). We then got it for switch and they adjusted well.

When they got stuck we encouraged them to try a few times before we did it. We'd also try to talk them through it before actually taking the controller. If possible we'd do it and then reset for them to try it after being shown, like flying across a huge gap and then flying back to let them try it. If they still couldn't do it we'd do it for them.

Things she can play on her own:

Animal Crossing- like PP said, this is the best motivation for reading

Pokemon- Sword or Shield, Scarlet or Violet, and Pokemon Snap are all good.

Paper Mario

Kirby- we don't have any of the new ones but my 5yo loves the SNES ones

Zoombinis Logical Journey

Bart Bonte's Factory Balls

There are a ton of puzzle games on Steam- my 5yo likes Zenge

Things to play by herself or with family:

Super Smash Bros 

Mario Kart

Ori and the Blind Forest

Yoku's Island Express

My nearly 6 yr son has expressed interest in a gaming console for his upcoming birthday.

Being 45 yr old, I grew up playing the first Nintendo, a PlayStation in my late teens, then a PS2 in college, and I loved playing Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and Medal of Honor, but stopped playing after that. I also tried a friend’s Xbox and game subscription awhile back until she moved away and that was an awesome way to try new games but I haven’t played anything for over a decade. So I’m completely out of the loop and confused as to what to buy so we can both enjoy it and what makes most sense financially as well.

A Playstation probably does have more creepy survival options but most of those will be too mature for a 6 year old.

My son plays, he is 9.5, he usually just enjoys building worlds and playing them, but he’s always so caught up trying to impress others just so they’ll be his friends. It hasn’t been an issue, until today 2 of these “friends” who have been playing nicely with him for a few days, all of a sudden accused him of being a “hacker” (have no idea hey), and they both left the friend group and blocked him. 
He has never been so devastated. I think he doesn’t understand why and it was his first time he felt included. 
Is it even worth reporting these kids? Or will it do nothing? 
I’m trying to take this as a real life learning experience, that online friends are different to his school friends and he wouldn’t have learnt this any other way. Regardless it is heartbreaking to watch him cry into the night.

The real issue is that anonymity and being removed from in person interactions makes it easy to act on our worst inhibitions.

Not sure if my punishment is enough.,kitcatchik94,2022-07-13,1657680547.0,269,"Daughter bought Robux on my card for a second time. Not sure if my punishment is enough.
I've never posted here, but I'm looking for some advice/ideas.

My 8 year old daughter loves Roblox and she used to get screentime to call her friends and play together on her iPad.  Over a week ago, I noticed I got locked out of my Amazon account and when I checked my email to get back into my account, there were hundreds of dollars of suspicious charges.  The customer service rep confirmed it was Roblox and it took over an hour over the phone but luckily they refunded it all.  They said it can be tricky to get refunded.

My daughter had her iPad taken away and wasn't allowed to talk to friends for a week.  I was under the impression that her iPad wasn't in Kid Mode and that must've allowed the purchases because in four years she had never bought anything before.

Today after a talk and promises to never ever do that again, I gave her the iPad back, with Kid Mode on.  Sure enough though, I was going through my email and I found a ton of purchases again, only a couple of hours after she got it back.  I was furious, we had another long conversation about how wrong it is to steal from mom and how disappointed and disgusted I am and I said that her iPad is gone indefinitely.  I'll have to call Amazon in the morning AGAIN to hopefully get that money back too because I'm broke.  Long story short I quit my job to care for my terminally ill mother and I haven't found anything remote yet, so I only have a couple hundred dollars in my checking as it is.  I'm fucked if Amazon doesn't refund me.

She was told there would again be no friends, no TV or anything fun tomorrow especially, just working with me outside or doing cleaning around the house.  I feel like I don't know how to make it sink in, or what to say to make her understand.  I never would've dreamed of doing this to my parents, and she looked ashamed but I feel like I don't know if she gets it.  Hell, I question if she's just so short-sighted that she didn't think there'd be any consequences or if she just doesn't respect me because she ignored everything we had just talked about.

Is there something I'm missing to make her understand?  I tried to explain that when she buys things online with my card, it's the same thing as reaching in my wallet and pulling out money.  I'm just not sure if it's not a serious enough consequence or if I need to focus more on how I discuss it with her to make her realize her wrongs.  I worry that she's not afraid of consequences or doesn't care enough about them which tells me that maybe I'm missing the mark and not getting through to her.  Is there something else I should add for a punishment?  Is there more I should add to the discussion?  I was flustered so I didn't ask about why she did it, just focused on how it felt to have her do that to me for a second time.  Honestly I don't know if the 'why' matters, I'm just hurt, afraid I can't get that money back, and feeling like I don't have my kid's respect.

TL;DR: My daughter made in-game purchases on my card, was punished, and immediately did it a second time when she got it back.  Not sure if my punishments or discussions are enough to make her change her behavior and understand how terrible stealing is.  How can I help her understand how serious this is and be sure she respects me?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the responses and suggestions.  Roblox is gone for sure.  I will continue my discussion with money and I will have her earn the money back.  I will say that after the first time I changed up the passwords, made sure that she couldn't get into my account without a second different password and I had assumed that without my adult account she couldn't make any purchases because the older iPad she had would always block purchases unless I logged in.  

I've gone through the game with her before and there are a lot of ads and in-game purchases, but she pointed them out to me and said, ""You have to buy those so don't click on them.""  So naively I thought she knew to never buy anything as this was long before the problem began.  I will talk to her more about the 'why' again, because I know she likes to video chat her friends and she might have felt pressured to buy that.",N/A,N/A

You are fighting against a marketing team and they will win unless you remove any way of making payments from your child's device - if this is not possible on an apple device I would recommend an android tablet.

Why did you get locked out of your *amazon* account? Roblox isn't connected to amazon in any way. Amazon only sells robux gift cards. Presumably, your daughter had to log into your amazon account, purchase robux digital gift cards, access your amazon digital items page or your email account, copy the gift code, use a web browser to access the roblox redeem codes website, log into her roblox account, and paste the gift codes. None of that is particularly challenging for an adult and kids are capable of figuring a lot of things out, I'm not saying your kid was extra devious for doing that. But I think you might have a fundamental misunderstanding about how kid mode works and what actually happened. This isn't something that was done through the roblox app. Apple has a lot of options for restricting access, maybe you are staying signed in to amazon with your card info saved or only restricting certain apps. 

You don't even understand what she did so it's going to be hard for you to explain it to her. I know that tech is confusing but you really need to get your own head around what is happening before doling out punishment. If you don't understand it, how can you expect her to understand it? It also sounds likely that you might be assuming everything is fine because of whatever ""kid mode"" you're turning on and not really monitoring her tech use at all. Most importantly, you need to understand the tech your kid uses well enough to prevent this from happening again and to protect your kid in the worst case scenario that she's talking to someone online who is manipulating her for some e-gift card scam. If tech isn't your thing, try to find a trusted friend you could ask to explain what happened and show you how to protect your accounts and kid. As you yourself come to understand what is happening, you may find you will be able to explain to your daughter what she is not allowed to do, and understand what punishment is necessary or if this was all a big misunderstanding.",ify57o3,N/A

First of all, if Amazon won't give your money back - you have a thing to sell. Yes, I'm talking about the iPad. Explain her why it's gone. Avoid buying snacks, sweets, everything that is unnecessary. When she will ask about it - calmly explain her that you really have no money. Really. So you was forced to sell it to feed her, and yet you have no money for extra stuff. I also heard about selling toys to compensate damage, or doing extra chores. If you need iPad for yourself - you can do ""no snacks"" part alone .

You also can explain her what budget is.
It works better if you have money in hand.

To be honest, it's not really your daughter's fault... Roblox is extremely predatory and uses all the tools possible to force the kids into buying and spending Robucks.

And that's not the only problem of this platform : pedophiles are happily grooming children everywhere, fascists are recruting and -on lighter note- the way the games are built will warp the way your kid perceive videogames, by destroying the balance between Reward, Effort and Frustration.

It’s like pulling the lever at a casino or checking the coin return in a machine. She literally has to fight her brain about doing it now that she’s been exposed to it.

It’s your job as a parent to lock that stuff down.

You CANNOT operate on “good faith” alone with a kid this age.

You’re saying ipad and not just tablet, so do the following:

If children in your Family Sharing group have their own devices, use [Ask to Buy](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201089) to screen and approve their purchase requests.
[Require a password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204030) for every purchase. NOT something guessable. A random combination of symbols, letters, and numbers. Do not save it on the device.

You can also turn off in-app purchases entirely using Screen Time on your own device or a child's device.

To use screen time: 

Settings > Screen Time, then tap Turn on Screen Time.
Tap Continue, then choose ""This is My [device]"" or ""This is My Child's [device]."" 
To prevent another family member from changing your settings, as the parent/on your device, tap Use Screen Time Passcode to create a passcode, then re-enter the passcode to confirm. In iOS 13.4 and later, after you confirm your passcode you'll be asked to enter your Apple ID and password. This can be used to reset your Screen Time passcode if you forget it. USE NEW and DIFFERENT codes and passwords! On your child's device, follow the prompts until you get to Parent Passcode and enter a passcode. Re-enter the passcode to confirm. In iOS 13.4 and later, after you confirm your passcode you'll be asked to enter your Apple ID and password.

Tap Content & Privacy Restrictions. If asked, enter your passcode, then turn on Content & Privacy. 
Tap iTunes & App Store Purchases. Tap in app purchases and select “Don’t Allow”. 

Finally, You can also go to Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions, and tap Allowed Apps. Then deselect iTunes Store and Books. Deselect Amazon, and any other apps or websites that are problematic.

You should also [set the parental controls for amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GB8P5MQSYFYHPCQ5) Again, new and different passwords! 

You should also disable One Click Payments. Go to Manage Default Address & One Click Settings > Click here to change default address > click edit next to the payment method.

You might also consider opening a Chime Account and making it the default payment method. This way, if she slips through, it gets declined.

DO ALL OF THIS.",ifzi634,N/A

Before you give it back, if you give it back, you should definitely unsave all of your bank card info, or even cancel the cards and getting new ones sent if you don't know how to get Amazon and apps to forget the info. Make it impossible for her to buy anything with your cards without getting you to come make the purchase yourself. 

I think you definitely need to understand the ""why."" If you don't know why she did it, you won't know how to explain why she shouldn't and mustn't again, and you might miss important steps you need to take beyond locking down your bank accounts. Just think through a few possible reasons - Is it peer pressure because she sees her friends doing it? Is it one friend convincing her it's worth it? Is it the game itself being too tempting? Does she not understand (despite your explanation) that it is real money and not play money? Does she understand that but not understand that hundreds of dollars is a lot? - each of those requires a different explanation and possible follow-up steps like contacting other parents, supervisingcertain friendships, deleting the game itself and not allowing future games driven by in-app purchases, or involving her in budgeting decisions so she learns what you both need money for.",ifyg9ho,N/A

Password protect or remove cards. 

It’s worth the hassle of having to enter your card. 

Also, you will NEVER get your kids respect through harsh punishments you can barely follow through with. You’ll only get more distance, secretiveness, and her becoming more attached to her friends.

You’ll get more respect through understanding her, showing you understand her, spending quality time with her, and explaining it’s not okay to make purchases without permission first. 

You might want to also look inward as to why it hurt you that she did something every smart and resourceful 8-year-old kid who doesn’t know better would do.

Not seeing money or a credit card or check might not make it click in her head that it’s money because it’s not a tangible thing. 

For the well-being of your child’s mental health and development I would stray away from punishing her with food as some have stated. I would also not throw your financial status in her face. explaining frugality is one thing, saying now we can’t pay bills because of you is another. Being mindful of your lessons and how they could be interpreted by a young undeveloped mind will help.

Some good framework for lesson learning can be:
-“Think of good deeds you can do to earn privileges” this can be behaving well, using polite manners with everyone, quietly doing an activity, helping with housework, helping put away groceries, etc.
- explaining why she cannot have the iPad until a time you deem appropriate
- age appropriate homework for summer enrichment, maybe money or math oriented to allow for stimulation for understanding 

Work on figuring out how it was able to happen, and stop it from happening. Kid mode does not protect your passwords or saved payment methods so maybe that’s why is leading to it, many apps allow Apple Pay, Amazon pay, PayPal, etc. 

You could absolutely sell the iPad for funds if necessary because clearly providing for your family is important. Also you could make it a password requirement for any game download and if it says in-app purchases act accordingly. 

I can see how frustrating and scary it is for you to have hundreds of dollars hanging in the balance.

I sometimes feel like maybe I am too careful (or even paranoid) when it comes to in-app-purchases. I have never entered any card info in my kids tablets or smartphones, ever.

To get robux my kid either has to buy a physical gift card with cash, or I buy a gift card for her on MY phone or laptop.

Thank you for sharing your story, I feel less silly and paranoid now.


Ask someone that would know more than you about how it all works for help.  Remove any card info etc from the iPad before giving it back to your kid.

But first ask kid to show you exactly how she did manage to buy stuff online - tell her you want to learn, and for both your safety you will remove that option. If she refuses to show you, you can tell her that in that case a factory reset will be the easiest way out, but she will probably lose content that way.


You can talk about how much money you make per hour, and how many hours of your work she tried to buy virtual stuff for.

Another thing to talk about is how gaming can be addictive, and how buying extra stuff in a game feels good at first, but then there is always that next thing to buy to make it _even better_ ... 

I told my 9 y old that I have a policy for myself when it comes to games, I never want to by anything in a game. I grew up with computer games that you bought on a disc, you purchased your game and then it was yours.
I dislike even the thought of being mid game and having to choose in that moment and feeling if something is worth paying for - so I have chosen to never buy anything in games.

I told her that I understand that Roblox is different from the kind of games I used to play (and some I play now) so I am open to her buying robux with her own money or giving her robux giftcards as presents.

BUT I also told her I _need her to understand_ that there has to be a limit - how much is a virtual t-shirt or some extra game really worth to her? What is reasonable per year? Month? 

We can always revisit those sums and what is important for her in her life might change - but she needs to figure out how important it is to her now so she doesn't want to spend silly amounts o her own money and get mad at me for being boring and saying no.

She thought about it and decided 10-20€ giftcards were reasonable as one time purchases maybe once a month? But the thought of putting more than 100€ on Roblox a year felt crazy to her.",ifyz7t0,N/A

I’ve since tightened up on spending for Roblox as it’s addictive and an expense I can’t afford.

I’m teaching him the value of money I now give him £10 in cash and say what do you want to spend this on? Once it’s gone it’s gone - now he can physically see the money he’s a lot more thoughtful about how he spends it. Sometimes it’s still Robux some times he’d prefer something else - and he asks a lot less now because he knows it’s an immediate “no” for robux (or any other kind of gaming) unless it’s his pocket money time. 

Taking away the iPad is teaching consequences but not teaching her about why it was wrong. I’d be inclined to try and use this as a teaching experience but for both of you, as she’s been able to access Amazon, which wasn’t blocked by you for use.

I’m too young to be parents right now but back then I was similar to your daughter who actually didn’t listen to my mom’s lessons. I lost my mom at a young age and because of how I acted when I was a child, I still have many regrets and wanting to apologize to my mom all the time.

You could probably remove any smart devices and gives her simple phone without any internet function which can still be bought nowadays. This could teach her to be less dependent on gaming and smart devices and really only use mobile phone for emergency call. I think children are getting too spoiled with smart devices nowadays that they don’t really have a proper childhood anymore. At a certain age, they would learn about all the technology but not at a young age. I had my first mobile phone when I was 15 for emergency purpose (the phone was useless beside making calls and sending text messages). And I got my first smartphone when I work for the first time and earned the money myself. 

Moreover, you should never give them monthly pocket money but for small errands they have to do if they want to buy something to teach them how difficult it is to earn money. Essentially, you have to explain to her why some children have things she doesn’t have just to let her know the situation, otherwise she would just feel less loved or even furious for not getting what she wants. She is still at a young age and can be taught, if she thinks she will lose her friends just because she can’t carry a piece of device around then they are not good friends overall. 

I don’t understand why children need to feel ashamed if they lack of something materialistic… I was poor but I never felt ashamed, my parents raised me perfectly fine and they worked hard. I found friends who are like-minded instead of pretending I’m financially ok. I was very proud of parents! I know that my parents always wanted the best for me. Those were the things I learned from my parents and I would do the same to teach my children one day.",ifzcl5y,N/A

Here's what we started with my kids and it's really helped them to understand that things cost money and that we can't just buy everything.  

Each kid gets an allowance every week that is equal to their age.  So my 7 year old gets $7 per week.  He has to split it between three jars (literally just old peanut butter jars that I cleaned out and labeled): 

1. Spend--weekly spending money that he can spend on anything he wants no questions asked.  This can be purchases in games, snacks at the store, goodies at school, whatever. 
2. Save --money he is saving toward some goal.  Recently his goal with to buy Super Smash Brothers for the Switch.  It was $50 and he had to save for a lot of weeks to get it. 
3. Giving--money for any kind of charitable giving.  Usually this goes to penny wars at school or buying school supplies for a supply drive or something, but they get to decide. 

If he gets extra money for any reason--like a birthday or he does extra chores and earns some extra dollars, he can decide what jar to put it in.  Most of his birthday money went into the Save jar to get his switch game.  

For the spend money, they now have to use that to buy things that I don't feel like I have to provide.  This might be in app purchases for games, extra treats at the store, pokemon cards, etc.  I also keep a box of things for them to ""buy"" at home that I have picked up when I find them.  Each item is marked with a price and they can ask to ""open the store"" any time they want to spend the money.  This has greatly reduced the amount of asking for things because they know that I'll tell them they have to buy it themselves with their money.  For online purchases, they pay me, then I buy it with my card. It also teaches them how long it can take to save up for something they really want.  Which then helps them take care of it because I won't replace it if it gets lost or broken.  They have to save up again. 

They also have to use their spend money to replace things that they lose or break.  For example, I recently bought my son a new water bottle that was bigger than his old one for soccer.  If he forgets that and it gets lost at the soccer field, he knows that he has to pay to replace it from his spend/save money.  I buy the first one, but if he loses it, he has to replace it.  

I should also add that every other week they pay ""taxes"" which is $1 that goes into a family tax jar that we will then use to do something or buy something that benefits the entire family.  This might be a family ice cream trip, spending money for an amusement park, etc.  But everyone in the family has to agree on the use of those dollars.",ifzuy2w,N/A

Because otherwise, you literally can just... not have the card info in the account / device for her. 

Not only that, but yeah there are settings (not kids mode, that just prevents a lot of apps from being installed without a preset parent account) to turn off purchases from either. Don't mean to be agressive, but at a bare minimum any parent giving a child access to a computer device should have scoured these settings and/or googled how they work. 

I mean yeah she loses the thing either way, but 8 year olds don't always develop this kind of impulse control. Most ADULTS don't. These games are made to break down impulse control of adults to make them want to buy things unreasonably. Of course they work VERY well on kids, which is what is so messed up about them right now.",ig06xun,N/A

But based on the comments, my understanding is that it is one of those games/apps where you need to pay a small fee to keep advancing in the game/app.

Apps and games like that are designed to be addictive and make you spend money. I used those before and honestly they are quite addictive.  Whenever I played and was told I had to pay for a fee to advance… I saw it as “oh. It’s only $4.  I’ll pay it now and stop next time… oh wait… I’m getting to the good part.  I’ll pay another $4 for now”.  And by the next day I’ll find out I spent $50 on the stupid app/game… and this is me as an adult with a pretty good grasp on money and using my own money.

So while I completely understand why you’re upset… I think you’re a bit unreasonable of your expectations of your daughter.  You gave her an addictive game and unlimited access to your credit card at an age where she doesn’t fully understand the importance of money and lack self discipline but you still expected her to make better decisions/choices than most adults.  You put her in a position to fail.

So if you want her to learn and do better then don’t put her the position to fail.  Delete your card information and Roblox.  

Teach her about money and consequences of using it.  If she spent $x dollars on Roblox then tell her she owes you $x (regardless if you get a refund or not).  So either she picks up more chores (assuming you do allowance) or sell items.

If she’s getting allowances then maybe put it on her own debit card / prepaid card and show her how to look at the transactions.  That way she can learn to be mindful of spending.",ig09vqs,N/A

Every day. And a lot of times the customer is baffled as to how it keeps happening. I don't know enough about the parental locks on devices that carry Amazon log info to point in a direction that would make sure you aren't charged with the ability to give the iPad back with full confidence that if she was intentionally doing it, she wouldn't be able to. 


With that being said, if it's in the hundreds a second time, I would surely hope that Amazon would do the right thing and refund you. 



I learned just how poor I was growing up at the age of 8, after my mother died. I was in a Taco Bell with my father and sister and had decided what I wanted to eat. I told my dad I wanted two things off of their value menu at the time, and he was blunt with me that I couldn't get both due to not having the money. I was taken aback, that the lowest of cost items were unobtainable. My dad worked three jobs at that time to make ends meet because he had to quit his job on the coast to come back home and raise us full time. From that point on I made it my mission to make sure that I never had to make my father tell me that I couldn't have something I wanted or needed. Food drove it home for me in our time of low funds. 



I'd suggest trying to drive a point home through food. Even if Amazon refunds you, I would take that amount and divide it by 12, and explain to her that the money that she wants to spend on her extremely momentary pleasure would cost her in other areas that she finds happiness in. 
Take each twelfth and let her know that the money is going to come out of her normal food consumption for the month. If it's around 20-30 ish each month, that's snacks and unnecessary foods that she cannot have for that month. She still gets her square meals and food that she needs, but no luxuries. A whole year. At her age she should be able to comprehend how long that must be without your favorites snacks and such. 


If she does this again, this money will come out of other areas that she finds pleasure in, toiletries that are nicer, clothes that she would want, outings, etc, money to do the extra things or field trips for school. The pure embarrassment of not going on a field trip and being left at school for the day should teach any child, but I digress. 


If the situation is that there is no room to even cut these to drive a point home, I'd have the conversation with her and flat let her know that this behavior in an adult is a crime. That she is lucky it was your card in the account and not someone else's that she would have to contest this with. 



I advise anyone who has had their children use their Amazon account in any way such as this, to never save your card to your account. Just add it through checkout when you place an order and let that be that. Yeah it's annoying to remember to renew Prime that way, but it's a great security step.

First off, the initial mistake is rough, but understandable. I feel like you did not fully make your kid understand what was happening and how wrong it is. She was just happy to get her toy back so she could go on Roblox. Then when she gets on, she goes on her favorite game. Then she sees any deals, then buys them. She wasn't spending her time thinking about the wrong she did. Clearly, since there is no way you can trust her to play without trying to spend, now you have to stop every way to make in game purchases. Take cards off of everything you can, don't connect any of your accounts to her device (amazon, paypal, anything used to send, receive, or spend money), and if you want to go the full mile, go into the router and ban the use of specific websites (like Youtube and Facebook) because they are not good for kids, even though we are conditioned to believe it's totally fine.",ifzoj48,N/A

Then explain that there are a lot of bills she doesn't see or understand because it is your job to manage the money. Show her the bills. Explain that the money she is taking has to go toward things like housing, food, light, and water first. After explaining that you spend your money on have-to's first and the extra can go to want-to's, then you can talk about your role as money manager. It is not her job to worry, but it is not her role to spend the money because it is a finite resource.

I think it might be time to take the opposite tactic - she may be so hooked on Roblox that she's spendng on the game like an addict, with the added issue of being ignorant (willfully or otherwise) of the consequences of her actions. While a bit of cold turkey (not having access to the game) can help in the short term, the moment she gets access back, there's nothing here that's going to change her behavior.

You're going to need a comprehensive plan that attacks the issue from multiple angles. First, you need to disable her ability to make purchases. Putting the tablet in kids mode isn't cutting it - either kids mode isn't restricting the purchases or, more likely, she knows how to get out of kids mode. Put a new pin on kids mode and don't let her know what it is. Don't write it down, either. Also set up a purchase pin for any purchases through the app store. As with kids mode, don't tell her what it is. Don't write it down. She's clever and probably knows where to look for these things.

Second, walk her through the charges that you needed to have reversed. Add them up together. Explain to her *exactly* how much money that is, and what the impact is on your livelihoods. If there are things she's wanted to buy or trips she's wanted to go on, explain in those terms ""You spent so much money that it could have bought fifteen of the dresses you were looking at last week"" kind of reasoning. Work out with her how long it would take for her to make that much money with an allowance or a newspaper route or chores around the house or the like. She's 8. She should be able to add, divide and multiply a little bit, and certainly have a sense for numbers that are big. Give her the big numbers, and make sure she understands them.

Third, outline exactly what's going to happen if she does anything like this again. The mommy repayment plan can be a thing - maybe she can do some housework or landscaping for family or neighbors to work off the debt? And make sure she understands that it's not a joke.",ifzs0j9,N/A

My advice would be to lock your card when you do not need it, set a spending cap so anything over a certain amount declines unless you authorize it (I get an email for these when I have a cap set) or log out of Amazon and make sure the password is not saved on any devices she uses. Also, you could enable text notifications or email notifications on purchases, pretty sure you can set it for a minimal amount to inform you too. I do this with my cards. I get a text shortly after a charge is made telling me how much and where it was spent. You can then more immediately dispute any unauthorized charges. Last scenario would be to unlink amazon from your payment info (a pain but she wouldn't be able to do it anymore). 

As for punishment, if she stole money from anyone else she would likely have had a cop talking to her. You need to tell her this is something that could get her in big big trouble, I would definitely make her work around the house more than her normal chores to ""pay you back"". Age appropriate chores of course. 

I'd also really consider selling the tablet since she is proving to you that she is not mature enough for one. If you have any unnecessary items, unused items, you could try selling them, but honestly that's hot or miss. 

You should also sit her down and discuss what a budget is and how electronic payments and physical cash works. You can list out what you make per month and your bills and how much and have it show what is left over, then you can explain that X is how much you should have had for the budget, but because she took $ without asking for permission that you only have Z until next payday. 

Talking finances with kids can be beneficial since it helps teach money management. If your handy with excel it makes it easy to show debt to income.",ifyb9p0,N/A

But seriously:  require a password for purchases, or delete your card from the account.  I'd much rather go through the tedium of re-entering my credit card info ALL THE TIME than have to deal with purchases I didn't sanction.  

Our kid used to do this all the time (with actual money, he'd steal change from our change jar) and it never really sunk in until one day it just did. He wasn't a bad kid, he just wanted stuff and it never really occurred to him that mom and dad have to work to earn the money to buy it.  I think I used to lie about money, too. There was no good reason for any of it; as gifted as I was as a child there was an element of wanting to fit in and wanting to have stuff that everyone else did, and that overrides the wrongness.  So don't worry, your kid is still a good kid, but after her punishment is over you need to give her a chance to prove it.  

One of the things I started doing was assigning my kid household chores; if he completed them he would get a small sum of money at the end of the day, but rather than give it to him outright, I would keep a running tab on how much I owed him.  This way when he wanted something he could see how much he has (in theory), have a moment to reflect upon why he wanted it, and only then will I give him the money to buy the thing.",ifzolye,N/A

Honestly I require a password for purchases for myself because it’s pretty easy to do it by accident. 

I’m addition to that I would focus your punishment into a correlated consequence. I would take away the I pad and explain that the iPad is for people mature enough to follow the rules our family has for it. I also don’t think it’s out of the question to have her help around the house to earn back the money she spent. Or working to earn her own money to spend on things she wants. Even if she makes change to spend on candy machines it may help her understand money more. However I wouldn’t take away tv or friends (outside of I pad). Odds are she didn’t do it out of malicious intent or didn’t understand how much money she was actually spending.

OP, this is not your 8 year old's fault, it's yours. She's a child who is at an age where she doesn't fully grasp technology, and, in fact, many kids her age don't get to use a tablet connected to the internet, and especially not one that has credit card access. You, however, are an adult, and if you're going to let a child her age use that kind of tech, then it's your responsibility to put a system in place that makes it so she can't make purchases. Not a system that requires \*her\* to exercise restraint, but one that takes the possibility away entirely. You might not be tech savvy, but it's still your responsibility.

This isn't a teenager who should know better, this is an 8 year old whose brain may not quite get boundaries and rules and moral behavior like we'd like her to. She'll grow into it. I know it's frustrating as a parent, especially considering your financial circumstances, but you have to be careful not to confuse worry over the money with anger for your daughter. Children will remember your anger and tone of voice for the rest of their life, and when you overreact, they don't hear the lesson because all their tiny brains can focus on is the anger in your voice and the fear or shame they feel because of how you're reacting to them.

Going forward, take deep breaths, go easy on her, don't make a huge deal out of small mistakes, especially ones that happen because she's little and doesn't really understand. Remember that her brain is developed enough for her to say the things you might want to hear (like ""I understand"" or ""I'm sorry, I won't do it again""), but at her age the emotional maturity, the moral behavior, the actual comprehension - those things come down the road, with lots of experience, and hopefully, gentle guidance from you.",ifyo51z,ify7xlh

Waiting ""until she has better self-control"" will likely be a permanent ban -- even most adults don't have the training to recognize all the different ways that they're being manipulated, let alone have practiced strategies for overcoming social conditioning needed to resist.

&#x200B;

Robert Cialdini has written a lot in cognitive psychology about what he's deemed ""Principles of Persuasion"", which are general techniques that are used to influence people's behavior.

Here's a brief summary of the principles:

[https://www.influenceatwork.com/7-principles-of-persuasion/](https://www.influenceatwork.com/7-principles-of-persuasion/) 

His book ""Influence"" is a good read if you want to dig in a little deeper:

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062937650/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062937650/) 

&#x200B;

Applying some of them to a common pattern you'll see in these types of games:

* If you login every day you get a free reward
   * Sets the stage for exploiting **reciprocity** \-- because they ""did something nice"" for you, your instinct is going to be to ""do something for them"" by complying with what they're asking
* The reward gets better each consecutive day you play
   * Exploits **consistency** \-- if you've convinced someone to do something once, they're far more likely to keep doing it
* The rewards reset if you miss a day
   * Exploits **scarcity** \-- when something is ""taken away"" (even if it's free), people instinctively perceive the cost of the ""loss"" as greater than what the item would have cost to acquire
* After you get the bonus, you'll presented with a ""limited"" offer to purchase something (only available to the first X players / Y players have already redeemed!)
   * Exploits **scarcity** \-- seeing that it's limited makes it appear more valuable and drives instinct to acquire something before it runs out
   * Exploits **social proof** \-- seeing that a large number of others have taken the offer makes you more likely to consider it a ""good idea"" to do as well
   * Exploits **reciprocity** \-- you're far more likely to take an offer because they've given you rewards",ifznufa,ify1n1u

But he doesn't really 'get it'.  He's EIGHT!  

So none of his devices or accounts for games he's allowed to play are even setup in any way that he could buy things or accidentally spend money (but he also 'understands' which things are free and cost real money in the games).

That said, I KNOW this is the right and only course of action for him because I also use Vbucks in fortnite as a way to teach him about money and saving--and my god I fail there.  ANY Vbucks money that he EVER has access to on his account from gifts or such, it's always spent IMMEDIATELY on whatever is in the store that moment, and a few hours later he wishes he spent it differently.

Even the most mature and advanced 8 year olds in the world that understand everything (in some magical world) are still FREAKING EIGHT!

Huh? Are you even a parent? Have you parented a child of this age? 


I completely disagree with you. You don't wait until they are teens to start to expect them to respect verbal boundaries. You can still have them cross a line and then have consequences. I had the same thing happen when my kiddo was the same age - with Robux. It was only for $12, but the discussion was had that it was stealing, and then we ate like paupers for the week 'because we didn't have any money left'. It was theft, but I need to be able to trust my kids around my money. I have cash and paywave available if they were in the habit of stealing. I had no complaints about the food that week, and it's not happened again. Bonus was I saved about $100 from the whole exercise.",ifyrdp7,ifyo51z

Children will remember your anger and tone of voice for the rest of their life, and when you overreact, they don't hear the lesson because all their tiny brains can focus on is the anger in your voice and the fear or shame they feel because of how you're reacting to them.

Nah that's absolute rubbish. She was told not to do something, and she continued to do it. It's nothing to do with it being technology related, it's to do with her ignoring rules. Kids need to learn to exercise restraint, it's not hard to understand ""don't do this"".",ifyzy7m,ifyo51z

Please try to keep learning. Don't rely on customer service reps to teach you. That's not really their job, especially an amazon employee trying to explain how an apple product works. Try to avoid using terms like ""kid mode"" and learn the actual terms for specific protections and what they mean by googling or asking questions. Two step verification wouldn't stop someone from making a purchase; two step verification refers to a protection that would stop someone from logging in to your account even if they learned your password. Your daughter didn't need to do that because you were already logged in. 

I still think you need to consider the possibility that your daughter is the victim of a gift card scammer chatting with her and telling her to buy gift cards. If that happened, it's possible your daughter never even got any of the robux she tried to buy, or didn't even realize she was using your account. She may have thought she was just doing a favor for her ""friend"" in the game. It's not super likely, but there are some red flags that mean you shouldn't rule it out. The fact that this happened suddenly, it was a fairly elaborate scheme, and it was hundreds of dollars instantly with no ""testing the waters"" makes it super suspicious. You also didn't mention your daughter ever asking you to buy her robux before. It would be one thing if your daughter kept asking you for robux and finally worked up the nerves to get it herself, and if that's what happened then you're probably fine. But if not, you might be shooting yourself in the foot by punishing her for being the victim of a scammer. You probably shouldn't have let her have unmonitored access to an app that lets her chat with strangers in the first place, but she will interact with more people who want to take advantage of her in the future.

An 8 year old having access to an addictive game and a credit card and acting on it is not something I would want my child feeling shame over. 

I think this is a parenting failure more than the child’s failure. I wouldn’t put 4 cookies in front of my two year olds and expect them to have the discipline to not eat them. 

I wouldn’t give my eight year old access to an addictive video game and a credit card and expect her to have the self-discipline to just not use it. Those are not age appropriate expectations, you’re setting the child up for failure. 

There are full on adults who are broke and still buy in app purchases - we expect the eight year old to have more self control than many adults?? 

If you do have children I would encourage you to look into the impact of shame on children. It impacts their self-esteem, their self-worth, and their picture of who they are as a person (and often times becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy - e.g. “you are bad and should be ashamed because you bought Roblox” now the child internalizes that she is bad. Next time she’s considering her actions she thinks I am bad what would a bad girl do?) there has been TONS of research done on this and particularly the impact of shame. 

Actions are bad, children aren’t bad. Again I think we likely have extremely different views including our parenting styles.",ig075b8,ig05g0o

It's a good thing to recognise how lucky you can be with the country you were born in, or moved to. But frankly it's unhelpful in this kind of discussion, it just pushes the conversation off the rails with some sort of angel of wokeness shit. 


It's a bit like someone talking about an issue with birthday party invites and having someone chime in that it doesn't matter because birthdays aren't celebrated in every culture. It's irrelevant. 


Your (fed) minimum wage in America is a fucking crime. People really struggle here too - housing is out of control. The average rent is equal to an entire week at minimum wage. The emergency housing list is exponentially increasing and people are living in motels and cars. Going out and buying a new device for a child is not an option in many households - INCLUDING MINE. My kids have devices that are hand-me downs from other people. I have a $100 2nd hand computer and a phone that is over a decade old that was given to me from someone who upgraded. I did try and make the point that I am not from an affluent household, yet my kids still have devices - like the vast majority of kids in 1st world countries.

Yes food is a big problem. Here, a child is more likely to have access to a smartphone and be without food than vice versa. (20% are sometimes food insecure, 97% of households have at least one smartphone. Most who don't would be elderly).

You seem to have completely lost track of the actual argument, which is the prevalence of smart devices available to children. You correlate device use with food insecurity, despite the quantitated availability of devices to many food insecure children. 


You seem to think that food insecurity doesn't matter to me, or that I think it doesn't exist.

How do you take to your kids about internet safety and do you use monitoring software like bark?
A scary thing happened, I looked at my daughter's text, she's 11. This is not something I would normally do but there was a concern. I found phone texts from a Roblox user. I have no idea how he got her number or if it's in the profile. Clearly I need to really discuss safety with by child. Nevertheless this person was chatting her up trying to get pics and sending pics. Photos sent were of a teenish boy, I don't believe they were real.

I don't believe she went on and contact stopped after that, texts dates last Thursday.
I guess I am a completely naive parent and need to talk to her about safety.

I am asking for advice from other parents about how they would handle the situation. My daughter is 11 and we moved to Australia about 5 years ago. In that time we lived in 3 states for work related reasons and I think that took a toll on my daughter’s social life. New language, different culture, missing family and then making friends with difficulty only to leave them during the next move. 
We have finally settled in a city about 2 hours from the state capital, bought our own place. She likes her school and is good friends with D. D has been a lot of support these 2 years with play dates and lots of activities together outside the school. D is also Indian and that might have been a factor contributing to their bonding as well. 


D called her just now from India to wish her happy new year and told her that her parents have decided to move to the state capital for better educational opportunities. We were both surprised. Admittedly, I am shattered and feeling very emotional. I have a one year old and I am already struggling to manage work, new baby and the dynamics between 2 sisters. This will leave my elder daughter alone. Again. She is a little shy but wants to be included. I think D was her tribe and now it will be back to loneliness. My heart is breaking for her.

I miss my family, my friends and the festival season has brought the feelings of isolation and loneliness back so strongly. How do me and my daughter navigate this?

So i have talked to my 7 year old daughter about online safety, in depth. No names, no ages or location. Ive also talked to her about grown adults that pretend to be kids , so no pretend kissing or boyfriends in roblox. She plays in the room with me and I'm ALWAYS around. I monitor her chats. Ive allowed the chats to happen because she talks with school friends and Ive actually honestly found it helps her with spelling/writing. Today I found out 2 of her online (non school) friends she engages in ""sex"" with. Asking opened ended questions and reading the logs the most she understands is its ""kissing in bed"", but the people talking to her obviously know what it is. They have found ways around the chat moderation features to type inappropriate stuff.  I'm disturbed and upset. I immediately blocked the offending players. She was devastated over losing friends. I explained its not her fault, shes not being punished, but I cant allow others to speak to her like that and that she needs to report them if They do. I explained that sex was how people made babies and that its not something someone her age needs to be doing or talking about. Im considering blocking the chat feature but I know she chats with her friends. I feel like a failure as a parent. This pandemic has been hard and honestly tablet time is the only baby sitter I get. Now ive spent the morning sobbing feeling like the worst mom. How could I let this happen? My husband is obviously upset but he also thinks she doesnt fully understand it, so I shouldnt be so hard on myself. Thoughts? Advice?

Please don’t listen to any negative self talk that is clearly not serving you. You’re doing your best under insane and intense circumstances. 

With Roblox, the first step is to turn off the chat function, and agree together how to manage and monitor ‘friends’. Sit together and agree the criteria for adding friends. Annoyingly, this is what almost every platform calls any other user you connect with. For kids, a friend is a friend is a friend. Not a random. This is sadly not as easy as blocking or banning or any other one-click action. It’s a series of conversations and sharing with each other, so your child understands that people aren’t alway who they say they are, and randoms online aren’t necessarily the same as friends offline. 

If it’s not Roblox today, it’ll be something else. It’s good to start today. And be honest. Tell her that you’re sorry, and worry, and can see she’s feeling hurt. You will both be fine.

I didn't open up the chat for him until he was 10 or so but even then (like you, I'm constantly monitoring activity, asking what they might be talking about, who he's playing with, etc. - just keeping the communication open and casual so he's more likely to be honest). I've not seen sex stuff but I've seen bullying, but, as a 90s kid who was an adolescent in the age of chat rooms, I remember well being approached online about sex stuff.

I didn't read through the other comments but maybe it's a good idea to communicate with her about what it means? This is a seriously complicated matter... On one hand, you wouldn't want to shut down a young girl's sexuality exploration as a message, but on the other hand... It's the INTERNET! Also, my son is an only child and Roblox friends have been his sole outlet and friendly communication during quarantine, so when he does something outside of Roblox that deserves a consequence, we have a hard time taking that away. Although we do sometimes.

Regardless, my husband and I decided to keep an open line of communication with him about things he's bound to see online. We keep tons of parental controls on his computer so we still have the reigns and we talk to him EVERY day about what's going on online. So far, he's stayed incredibly open and honest. 

Maybe this is isn't advise or anything... But I know the feeling. While we haven't seen sex stuff, some of the Roblox communities worry me. Royale High and Adopt Me in particular. We encourage him to get into communities where there are challenges and team work.

Recently, she told me she wants to be a non-binary. I even asked her what it is about.

Her friends will have older siblings or cousins in middle school and everything is fair game by then. They love sharing with their younger sibs. You can’t shield her from the information, but you can have honest and open conversations about every topic she brings up. If she brings up non-binary, talk very intensely about what it is and what it means. Do not assume she knows the correct definition and application, as you appear to already have a good start with. It’s better for her to hear the truth from you than misinformation from others. 

A funny, relevant story: When I was exactly ten, I told my dad I was half-lesbian. He was extremely taken aback, wasn’t sure where I had learned about it, and started asking more questions. (This was way before Discord btw. Kids just find out.) Anyway, turns out I asked my grandma what lesbian meant and she said it’s the same thing as Lebanese. She was trying to avoid the conversation and didn’t think I was old enough. So in my mind, lesbian=Lebanese were interchangeable. I thought that for months. A very educational moment for us both and I was thrilled he was honest and open with the definition of lesbian, unlike my grandmother was, as I immediately felt the failure she set me up for by not explaining it to me when she could. Thank goodness my dad was open, honest, and gentle with the explanation or I could have embarrassed myself horridly in a different situation.",iwegikd,N/A

If she is truly *only* chatting and playing with friends who you know, then I don’t think it’s a concern. They would have the same conversations in real life.

I have super strict controls on all my kids devices and only my 14 year old has any sort of social media. I make her log in on my phone so that I can read anything IF I want to. (I typically don't, but she knows I could if I wanted to).",iwimrg3,N/A

Our nearly-ten-year-old son just started 4th grade, and told us he has no friends. Not in a depressed way, just matter-of-fact in response to us asking if he wanted to invite friends for his birthday.

He's on the autism spectrum but is very bright and enjoys things that a neurotypical ten-year-old does: Minecraft/Roblox, Mario (and video games generally), minions, funny cat videos, explosions and action movies and fart jokes, etc. He's a possibly a little more non-sequitur about his interests than maybe the average kid would be,  but he's not fixated and he can go with the flow.

His biggest obvious marker is a speech impediment -- he pretty obviously doesn't say his Rs correctly, and it's severe enough that even I sometimes need him to repeat himself or enunciate more clearly, but he speaks fluently and uses age-appropriate vocabulary, etc. I'm sure this is an obstacle for socialization, but he's in speech therapy and is working on it -- he's made a lot of improvements, and the R thing is the big one that he's working on now.

He'll independently talk to other kids and even join in with them if they're playing a game, but a lot of times he's just doing his own thing -- if we take him to the park he'll sometimes play tag with other kids, but other times he'll just climb on the net or swing on the zipline by himself, or whatever. When he does interact with other kids he's friendly and polite and helpful, good about taking turns, etc, so I know it's not that he's hard to get along with.

But I don't know how to help him make friends. We live in a neighborhood where most of the kids are much older or younger. We also have be a 7-year-old daughter, and we set up play dates for her with our friends' kids (and we include our son in those, too, but sometimes he isn't interested in playing with 7-year-old girls), but nobody we know has a son around his age. There's a neighbor girl who is in his class at school and we spend time with their family (they also have a 6-year-old son) and our kids get along (e.g., they're excited to get together and play video games, or play games, or go to the park together), but at 10 boys and girls typically don't want to be close friends, even if they get along well (plus, I can tell that the neighbor girl likes our son well enough but doesn't see him as a close friend).

He's not very athletic, although we put him in stuff like swimming lessons and karate and golf camp and he enjoys those well enough, and gets along with the other kids but there's usually an age gap. Also, he has a hard time with repeated defeat and frustration and is a bit more timid than other kids when it comes to physical risk, and he hasn't really expressed interest even when asked, so we haven't signed him up for team sports. We put him in other group activities like robot camp and French class, and he has fun in those, but they usually but very long and usually have a wider age range, too.

We've spoken to his teacher and school counselor, and his teacher says he's friendly and happy in class and gets along with the other kids, but at recess and such tend to spend time by himself. The counselor added a goal to his IEP to improve social relationships, but I'm unclear how that's happening and he's obviously still mostly a loner.

My heart breaks for him. He's such a great kid, but between the autism and the pandemic lockdowns he hasn't learned to make friends, and there haven't been any organic opportunities among our friends group or in the neighborhood, so most of his socialization is at school. He's so smart and capable and has made so much progress in so many areas of his life, but I worry for his future if he's unable to find a friend group.",N/A,N/A

I’m not sad about it. I felt more pressure when forced to interact in lessons and other social activities and despite these social interaction ordeals I don’t struggle socially as an adult. Just it’s all within my terms where as a child you don’t always get a choice.

You could argue you don’t get a choice interacting within work environments but as an adult we choose those environments we are in. 

You’re son despite the challenges will likely find a group of friends whom are friends for life and stick with them. This happened for me at 17, because I got to choose who I wanted my friends to be. School and social things from the age of 10 is meaningless to me. 

I say above because your son sounds somewhat chilled about it and that was me. But all I’d say is keep checking up on him, because that doesn’t mean that on those odd days I didn’t feel lonely, just as a whole didn’t bother me.

Edit: ooo and I find verbal positivity extremely helpful and I’m using it on my daughter… e.g. “you’ve got this.” And “wow you’re really brave.” My daughters a lot younger than 10… but I just want her to believe in herself no matter what a day brings.",ir0tmwj,N/A

Obviously these will only work if they spark some interest in your son but it might be worth trying. He also might just be a bit mature for his age. I generally didn't like other kids at that age (to be honest, 10 year olds can be capricious and cruel little shits) and was much more comfortable in the company of adults or just reading or playing video games. When I went into fourth grade we had just moved to a new state and I didn't make any close friends the first year and thinking back on it I didn't ever feel lonely or like I was missing out. I actually can't even remember what we did for my birthday that year so not having friends to invite over that year didn't scar me or anything.

So my friend moved to our area in 2nd grade and somehow just joined our mummy group. We’re nice, don’t get me wrong, but she just somehow slid in and that was it 😂 So her son became friends with our boys. The thing is he did stick out a little because of his idiosyncrasies but all our kids didn’t care and it’s just one big group. It’s very sports based and you either join in or go find something else to do. My friend’s son would often be doing his own thing like pretending to be a dinosaur in the middle of a soccer match lol but whatever. Ok the other kids might yell if he let a goal in but they yell at each other all the time. The kids are also aware of autism and how it can make people act differently and they know it’s fine and not be be aggrieved etc. As a group we also did play dates, some more successful than others, and her son was also incredibly content to play solo, use his amazing imagination (unlike my son!), study for fun, do science experiments, crafts etc. So of course you want him to have friends and socialise but it does sound like he is happy to entertain himself and try different things.

I’m not concerned because he’s going to find his People later on (as soon as he gets into a robotics club or advanced engineering class, lol).

Regardless, he's going to continue to mature and in a few years, be in middle school and meet more kids, some of whom might be on his wavelength. Also, it's great that you've identified he gets along well with girls too. Definitely a beneficial way to help socialize him in a well-rounded way, especially as you mentioned a lack of kids around his age.

Either way, sounds your guy is doing his thing, is happy being social but has a natural tendency to fly solo. Sounds plenty healthy to me.",ir30pgh,N/A

But he's also been expressing interest in having people come over and play, but if we ask him who he would like to invite he doesn't know. It's just a generalized interest in doing kid things with other kids. And there are plenty of things he would like to do that involve multiple people (e.g., nerf wars) that he just can't do because he doesn't have anyone in his social circle that will do that sort of thing. We had a water balloon fight this summer where we invited a few of our friends' kids and some neighbor kids and that seemed to be the highlight of summer vacation for him.

He tries to get his little sister to do some things with him but eventually one of them becomes frustrated with the other because their skill levels are so far apart; so then he comes to me, and although I'm happy to have a good relationship with my kid and enjoy spending time with him, I can't always be available when he needs, and a friendship between parent and child isn't the same as one between peers.

There was a specific girl (he seems to get along better with girls, but most of his interests are stereotypical boy things) from his class in school last year that he wanted to invite over to play, and so we coached him on how to ask her if she wanted to come to our house some time and to give her a note with my phone number so her parents could call, but nothing ever came of that. (Not sure why -- could be a mismatch of affections, or maybe her parents were flakes, or maybe the note never made it home?)

But even if he's content now, if that changes in the future he's going to struggle if he hasn't developed the social skills needed to build and maintain friendships.",ir17xcy,ir11vhq

I am married (living together) with a 7 yo right now. My spouse is using our child to punish me when I don't do what she wants. She takes our child out for up to an entire day (so far) without telling me where. I try calling, texting, and usually get no response. Last time this happened for an entire day, there was only one phone call which my daughter made to me from my spouse's phone to ask for a Roblox password. When they got home, I asked my daughter where she was, and ""Mommy told me I couldn't tell you"". I then coaxed the answer out of her, just to a mutual friend's house.

My child is out right now as I type this, and I have no idea where they are. What actions should I take?

PS - please let me know if I choose to right flair and location to post this

Edit: People asking for more to the story: My friend just recently passed away. I was going through grief and still managed to help do laundry all day after I finished work. My wife told me not to work the next day (I didn't anyway) then said she wanted to watch the Harry Potter series all day as a family. I told her I was waiting weeks to watch stranger things and it came out. She said we could go to the theaters and I said I didn't want to see minions 2. I suggested other things, but she didn't want to see anything else, just minions 2. After they got tickets, my friend called and asked if I could go to my friend who passed away's burial. I said yes and was glad I didn't get tickets for the movie. I told my daughter about who died and my wife tried to interject and I ignored her and told my daughter and told her where I was going instead of the movie. Then my wife went out the movies with her. After the movie was done, I tried calling because it was my friend's child's birthday and even though we went to a burial we were still trying to celebrate the birthday and my friend wanted my wife and daughter to come by. She never answered the phone or responded to my texts. The next day she just randomly came home. The mutual friend we have was a woman, so this wasn't about cheating, she was angry I didn't make the day a family day. But today she did the same thing, took our daughter out and wasn't answering my calls or texts. They are about to take a trip out of country, and I was supposed to go, but I feel like I'm just being used and she just wants me there just to show she has a husband (edit: as in to keep up appearances), not because she actually wants me there, and considering what she did with this whole taking daughter out and not telling me where was my final decision on if I was going with them.

Hopefully that extra part clears up the why she did it, but regardless of why, I don't think it's right. I told her she can go wherever she wants and doesn't have to tell me, but if she takes our child, I need to know where our child is to put my mind at ease and in case anything happens I can know where they were.",N/A,N/A

Unfortunately there is nothing to enforce about what she is doing. She is the parent and can make decisions for the child in her care just as you can.
If she is attempting to use this as a punishment, make it ineffective.  Unless you are worried about your child's safety, try not to let it bother you.  As your kids get older you know less and less about their life beyond you when they are at school and such, but I know it is hard when they are so young.   If you know she is safe and with someone with good judgement, leave it alone.   Once it isn't getting an effect from you the behavior will stop.

Get a therapist for you, be honest and shoot straight. See what else you can clarify for yourself, and learn some tools for navigating these troubled waters with your daughter (whether or not you & mom stay together, these will be invaluable to you and your kid)

Consult a family law/divorce attorney, knowing your options and having that back-up is confidence boosting and takes a lot of the anxiety of not knowing out of the equation. You can be up front in asking for an initial consultation, with the understanding that you don’t want to sign any representation agreements or pay any retainers yet. You’re looking for information and to be prepared, and any attorney that’s not interested in or able to offer that is not your best bet right now. You need someone who will tell you straight while also supporting your decisions, vs someone who is angling for whatever or has their own agenda. 

Spend time with your kid. Real time. As much as you can. Be a clear and safe person for her, and as appropriate and with guidance from your therapist, start letting your daughter know that she should *never* be asked, however directly or indirectly, to keep secrets from *either* you or her mom. Talk with her about the burdens of keeping secrets and why you don’t want her to have to carry those burdens, *without* trash talking your wife and most importantly in a way that absolves your daughter of any guilt/responsibility for having been asked to keep secrets. She needs to know that adults are there to protect her and that any adult who can’t or won’t do that is not someone whose secrets should be kept, in particular. 

With a combination of these three facets, I’m fairly confident that your next steps with wife will become clearer, and a lot less agonizing.

Unless you file for full custody, but you probably won't get it. It will most likely be split. And then the situation just goes back to how it is now but with courts involved. Probably wouldn't get any better. Maybe try Google to see if there is a clause in joint custody where you have to make the other party aware of location and/or activity. 

Personally my approach would be to buy the kid a phone. GPS tracker incase ""kid loses phone. 😉"" Also have the other parent have access to the same information so everything is fair and there would be no need to escalate. 
Maybe depending on intent and other factors. I might try allowing it.. not being bothered by it.. maybe the other parent can take the kid for a day and give you a break. Pub time or whatever your in too. And then repay the favour by looking after the kid so the other parent gets a break. But I wouldn't be too confrontational about it. 

Regarding the question ""Does my spouse have an obligation to tell me where they are taking our child?"" I believe if there is no contact within 24 hours and they have not stated where they are going or when they would be back. Then file a missing persons report""  I think if this would to happen a few times. Then you could maybe get a court order so that she would be legally obligated to inform you of the child's activity and whereabouts. I'm not a lawyer. But if it is a problem you feel like you really need fixing. Then speak to a lawyer. If you can't afford a lawyer, try find a pro bono one. If it's fairly simple and it can be solved with ABIT of legal insight. Then a email to a pro bono lawyer asking for help and advice, will probably return an email telling you what you have to do.

From the limited info we’ve got here, it sounds like she was annoyed that you weren’t showing up as a partner in the exact way she wanted you to (ignoring your time of grief), and decided to just go about her business and exclude you (as perhaps she felt excluded? We don’t know). It sounds like this behavior has left you feeling undervalued and ignored.

It also sounds like y’all don’t communicate well in general—each just stating what you want to/are going to do and not budging or even listening to what the other person wants. You have a history together that lead up to these issues in your relationship and Reddit can’t help you reflect on that.

If you still love her and want to be a family, I’d start with talking to your wife when the kiddo is with a sitter/family. Tell her you appreciate her keeping kiddos life on track when you were struggling, but that it was really hard for you when your friend died and that you didn’t feel safe/accepted by her when you needed time to grieve. Tell her that you’re all in this family together and need to figure out how to respect and include each other and that you’re willing to do the work too. 

If you’re calm and sincere and she shuts you down, I’d consider counseling and/or leaving. If she continues to drive a wedge between you and your child, I’d start working on learning how to coparent (start/resume playing an active role in your kiddos life, book daddy time with her, get interested in what your wife has going on for her) and get out.

Go on the vacation. Take an active role (which involves getting enthusiastic about her plans where you can, making plans together, taking responsibility for your share of the planning, packing, schlepping, kid entertaining etc), be a father and try to be a partner, and if that doesn’t open the lines of communication, work on separating in a way that’s functional for your kid and secures your role in her (kiddo’s) life.",ieykdlw,N/A

1-shes not really into your marriage. 
2-shes okay with hurting you. 
3-you need security cameras inside and outside your home. Secret ones would be best, if not then make sure she doesn't have full access to them. Make sure you can save videos if needed for divorce court. 
4-start preparing for a divorce.  Do not let her know or she will do everything she can to fuck you over. Talk to a lawyer , find out what you need to do for protection. Like how to keep the house. Make sure you can get at least 50/50 custody.  Tell a few close friends or family members . 
5- she's intentionally doing this to get a reaction from you. Learn how to act like a cat. Bitch you don't care. If she leaves the house with the kid, post a video of you having fun. When she comes back, ask how her day went. Do not give her what she wants.",ieuy000,N/A

Find a good time when you and your wife are calm and have privacy from your child. You both obviously not have built a good foundation of communication and trust. And extra stress like a death puts these things to the test. But it may not be too late to alter course.

Talk to her about what you are currently going through and what you are feeling. Don't tell her how she should change, just explain how it all makes you feel. Then ask her what she's feeling.

Here’s my take:
I think OP is being overly controlling. Ask yourself why did mommy say dad couldn’t know where they were? From the constant need to monitor where they are, I’m going to assume that OP is abusive (to what degree I don’t know) and controlling and mom needs a safe place to retreat to. 

It’s time to grow up and have an honest conversation with mom about how she feels regarding the marriage. She may feel trapped and worried about escalation of control and manipulation by OP. It may just be that OP is needy and she needs a break from time to time.

Then you can a child's passport so when they scan it at an airport you need both parents permission to cross any borders. This would prevent your other half from taking the child to Russia/north Korea/China or  somewhere else that wouldn't cooperate with European/US law enforcement. You have to file a form from the home office I think but double check with a lawyer if you need to go down that route.. which you probably won't this is an extreme measure to take given the information you have given me.,ieussev,ieus1mc

My friend was insisting I kept trying to contact her and find out if they could come to eat cake and ice cream and wish her kid a happy birthday. ""Mommy told me I couldn't tell you"" when they returned, is 100% what happened.

You don't know anything about my wife. The things you accuse me of are the tactics she uses. She undermines me, doesn't discipline my daughter (she leaves that to me), and doesn't accept when she is at fault for anything. A mutual friend of ours said ""She does like to take things to the extreme"" and ""It's her way or the highway"" when I talked to her about the situation. I have often told her she needs to take a break from being around me, but she is resistant to that. She says ""We are married and we need to do everything together and be around each other for everything"".

Also, lastly, I have a therapist and I've had one for over a year. I am trying to better myself. I am honest with her, just like I am honest here. I don't exactly know what more you want me to add to the story, but there isn't much else to add here.

You are way off base here. I'm not sure what you think you know, but you have no idea what kind of situations I have to go through. I'm not perfect, and I do not make that claim at all, but I am not a liar, and there is nothing in my post that I left out to put myself in a better light and make her look like the bad person. The most important thing is that my wife should not be pitting my daughter against me. There is no reason for that. I have devoted my life to protecting my daughter and trying to give her the most healthy childhood possible, and I am currently having someone actively try and make me the bad guy to her. She talks bad about me to my daughter. She prevents me from telling her what to do. ""It's time for bed."" ""No she can stay up and watch this show."" ""You have to brush your teeth."" ""No, she can just do it in the morning."" (She doesn't) There is more, but it just isn't necessary to get in to the nitty gritty of every single issue in our lives on a Reddit post about one singular issue that I am looking for advice on, not here to garner sympathy or farm karma. There are much better ways to do that, and I certainly wouldn't use my daughter and my private life to accomplish such things.

That is part of being an adult, and not being able to do it will make this situation much worse.  

If you can’t cool off fast enough, you will see symptoms.  Family members may shy away from talking to you, and they might go looking for a calm place to be when you are stressful to be close to, at least until you have time to calm down.  

Honestly, you’re probably going to be better off inviting over a mutual friend if you’re boiling over, your wife is less likely to go out and more likely to be polite without you having to ask.

That means you aren’t aware of the dark, hurtful things that people can do to each other. Childhood trauma is activated by becoming a parent in a way that nothing else does. 

Why would a woman choose to hide her location from her husband? Why would she feel the need to take her child somewhere else to feel safe? If this guy is grieving, stressed, tense due to marital issues, that’s the perfect time for thinking errors and the voice of the trauma-goblin to come out. 

This could range anywhere from wife wants to give him space to grieve and doesn’t want daughter to be caught up in mourning someone she doesn’t know, all the way up to something more sinister. 

My point is, we are only hearing his side.

My wife and I have been going through some very similar problems. We were both raised by narcissistic parents and each of us displays narcissistic tendencies as well as co dependence. Our therapist told us we were in a toxic relationship and that we needed to own our shit. 

So pick yourself up. Own your shit. Stop acting like a victim because you have chosen to be with her. Now it’s time to work things out.

My wife and I were able to grow tremendously and she said sorry for the first time in our marriage when we completed our therapy. 

You may not have the same results, my wife and I have a serious trauma bond that is more like the bond combat Veteran’s share (I am a vet with PTSD as well).

It's only a miracle my daughter and I did not get it, and I insisted that she quarantine in our room for the recommended amount of days.

These are just examples though, and the more serious worries is that something could happen to them, and I have no idea where they were and the police would not be able to help.

I think it’s common courtesy to let your spouse know if you’ll be back late etc. If my spouse was asking where the children and I were, I would not hide that from them. 

But your post and comments feel to me like there might be more behind this. You sound kind of exhausting, if I’m honest. 

1. You said (in the comment I responded to) that your number one reason for wanting to know exactly where your wife is with your child at all times is to make sure she is safe so you don’t have to worry. When I asked you why you would worry you said her bad driving (fair) and that she once got covid (totally insane). You then went on to say that wasn’t really the reason. 

2. Do you update your wife of your every move in case something happens to you and she has to call the cops? That would not be normal, in my experience. You say that you have a “serious worry” that something might happen to them and you can’t tell the police exactly where they were. That sounds like pretty obsessive thinking to me - I don’t really ever worry about vanishingly rare events happening to my spouse. Certainly not enough to need to know where they are at all times. 

3. When I asked you why you feared for your child’s safety when out with your wife, you jumped immediately to “you definitely think it’s ok to disappear all day and not message your spouse”. Despite me giving you no reason whatsoever to think that.

Then he edits the post to pull on our heartstrings by saying his friend was being buried that day. That’s the same day that he helped her fold all the laundry after working all day. It’s the same day that his buddy’s daughter was having a birthday. 

Ok ok. If it’s a funeral, why are you going out to the movies like it’s not the funeral of your buddy? Why would he want to stay and celebrate his friend’s daughter’s birthday instead of going home to be with his own daughter? The more you dig, it the more it sounds like bullshit.

If I don’t hear from my wife, and my kid is with her, I don’t worry. I will see them later and get the full story. No big deal. 

“Don’t I have a right to know where my kid is?” Yeah, she is with your wife at her friends house playing Roblox. What’s the big fucking deal? The big deal is that he is obsessed with showing us how she doesn’t do what he wants her to do (the wife) and he wants us to give him a pass on his own bad behavior. 

Having lived under the yoke of a narcissist, I can say with confidence that you his guy is ‘sus’. I give him the benefit of the doubt because we all deserve that when the facts are not known. I’m suggesting that he seek counseling because there is an unhealthy dynamic there. Wether he is codependent, OCD, or a true narcissist is beyond my ability to say.

The point is, YOU don't know for sure, so YOU probably should not be recommending immediate divorce.

I was personally a bit put off by ops edit regarding not wanting to go to the movies, and not buying the ticket. It sounded to me like the wife was trying to spend family time (family movie) and compromise with watching something, but op was insistent on watching Stranger Things, which is not appropriate for children. The funeral stuff came after that tidbit. As for the wife, I speculated while reading that she was either giving unhealthy payback to op in attempt to show him how she felt, or visiting a lawyer or leaning on her support system while she devises a plan to leave him, which would explain the secret.

Of course this is speculation that I am drawing on some of my experiences to create, but I see no reason to trust op, or anyone, at face value on a random post on the internet. In any case counseling sounds like the best next step.",iewf4lg,iew5z88

Instead of vilifying me, and wasting efforts in an attempt to prove my hypocrisy, maybe you can swallow your ego and accept that things are not black and white. In terms of mental health, there are all shades of grey. Being a narcissist does not mean he doesn’t love his family. Being controlling means he has a lot of anxiety. It’s only after accepting the truth about ourselves that we can grow and learn to improve our lives.

At the start of COVID we permitted some behavior we would not normally have allowed as we were in survival mode and just trying to navigate to get through each day. There was so much disappointment with cancelled birthday parties, sports, camps etc. that we became lenient on the issue of Robux. Before COVID we never permitted the boys to have them. One way my two boys, currently ages 11 and 8, were able to have a social life then was by playing Roblox over zoom with their friends. The friends were all getting Robux to spend on micro transactions and so they started begging and begging for them. I gave in because it was the only thing that I could provide that wasn't getting canceled. We still limited receiving Robux to gift cards they got for special occasions or things that they could earn through chores or good behavior. We did explain at the time that this was a special thing and not typical and that we did not support giving money to these games through microtransactions in a way that could result in addiction. Obviously we knew that our kids didn't fully understand this but we were trying to plant to see that microtransactions were not healthy and generally were not necessary to enjoy a game. My older son totally understands and even calls it a scam. My younger son does not understand and it has become a big source of tension as he relentlessly begs for Robux to buy upgrades to the equipment he uses in the games. He throws fits about it and obsesses. He will beg for weeks at a time and not let it go. We have tried to reason with him. We have explained to him in child appropriate language how microtransactions work. We have talked to him about the psychology of marketing. We have added up all the money he has spent on Robux (mostly from gift cards he's gotten for birthdays and Christmas) to show to him that it's not just a dollar here or a dollar there. These approaches are not working and he is just fixated on spending Robux to buy these upgrades. I had intended to continue to let the boys still receive Robux gift cards for special occasions that they could have total control over in order for them to learn how to manage their own spending, but I'm now wondering if instead my youngest son is growing addicted through the dopamine hits he gets by buying the upgraded virtual equipment in these games. I'm looking for any thoughts on this issue, but would love to hear if anybody has found child appropriate resources to help kids understand how microtransactions work and how he is potentially being set up for a lifetime of not being able to resist the psychology of the instant purchase.

TLDR; looking for resources appropriate for a tween boy to understand why microtransactions in video games use psychology to create addiction in order to get him to want to spend more money.",N/A,N/A

Micro transaction, sometimes I think they are okay. You buy a thing and use that thing in game. Is it that different from a Lego set you buy, build once, then never want to take apart? An ice cream at the zoo that costs 3x what you'd get at home? Movie ticket, after you watch the movie you don't get have anything in return.

We are of the firm belief that a game shouldn't require spending extra money (beyond the initial purchase cost) to complete/beat.  If it does, it's a scam. Roblox is not that kind of game, but what is similar is asking yourself ""how much does spending money on those extra features really add to the enjoyment?"" What does that outfit really change besides your appearance? How does this affect the gameplay?

We told them that they're welcome to ask for gift cards for it for their birthdays and Christmas, but we have never allowed them to use their allowance or our credit cards for Robux.  They've gotten a few gift cards and codes from things like physical Roblox toys (which they do play with regularly), but they accepted the fact that we weren't giving in on this long ago.

But taking it away once they've already had it is different than never allowing it in the first place. That's going to be harder and you're likely to hear them complain about it for a while, but stick to your guns and they'll get over it eventually. Could take months, but stand firm! Maybe remind them that if they're not having fun without these extras, they're welcome to stop playing.

You need to talk to him about peer pressure. It’s no different than if a friend of his came to school wearing a backpack he really liked.

If your son is throwing fits and unable to control his emotions when it comes to this issue, it’s time to step away from the game for a while. Kids can easily become obsessed with things, like games, and it’s important to take a break if they are not maintaining a healthy relationship with games.

My kids play games, including Roblox, but if we start seeing emotional disregulation, we take a break.

There are so many hobbies that are kid friendly that can be explored. Hiking, camping, painting, build projects, cooking, baking, re-purpose crafting, biking, gardening, bird watching, geo-caching, musical instruments, sports, diorama making, the list goes on. Some are more expensive than others so try a handful that’s in your budget and go from there. Learning how to refocus attention is an important skill for kids to learn. It helps them in schooling and later on work and projects. Maybe take it a step further and get them a subscription to an educational website like adventure academy or prodigy. If the tone of the household is overall whiny, jump up and say “Shoes and jackets/hats, on!” And take them for a walk. Non-negotiable. Don’t fall into their trap of a fight. Find something outside and point to it. “Look at that spider/bird/plant! How beautiful!” It’s hard for kids to be mad and bicker at you when you just don’t acknowledge it.

The stuff she mentions specifically (sudden progress blocks that require robux to overcome after building investment in the child) is also definitely on the scammy, or at least scummy, side of things.

A lot of these games are also built around building investment and then suddenly blocking the experience you were already enjoying past a paywall.

Hey all. Long time, first time. Anyways...  


So I have a 6 year old in 1st grade. Normal upbringing and family life. No major trauma or abuse or anything that I'm aware of. Lately, whenever she is disciplined for any type of wrongdoing her response has been turning incredibly...dark. No matter how calmly I try to explain what she did wrong and why it was wrong (and punishment is typically a 6 minute time-out) she immediately turns to comments such as ""I'm so stupid"" and ""I can't do anything right"" and it has recently and abruptly changed to ""I'm going to run away"" and the other day she straight up sat down and said ""I'm going to kill myself"" and double-downed on this later.       
We were shocked and heartbroken. I've had a number of talks with her since, trying to ask her more about what she's feeling and why and make sure she understands the gravity of her thoughts while doing my best to be gentle and not press too hard but also let her know that she can talk to us but she doesn't have to right away if she doesn't want to. She essentially says that she would rather be dead so that she doesn't have to deal with her bad feelings/discipline. I've of course reiterated the permanence of death and that she can always talk to parents/teachers/friends or whomever she feels comfortable with and we can think of ways to deal with these feelings etc.

The basic thing people do in this situation is to tell someone not to talk about death in that way, which seems misguided at first, but is similar to what therapists help with. They help with negative thinking and suicidal ideation, the latter of which is often criteria for treatment of depression and some other disorders.

It's good for people to learn not to be so hard on themselves, in general. It's good to be self-critical in order to become better, but calling yourself stupid all the time is just not healthy to me and doesn't help people learn and develop at all.",iyw71jt,N/A

No matter how calmly I try to explain what she did wrong and why it was wrong (and punishment is typically a 6 minute time-out) she immediately turns to comments such as ""I'm so stupid"" and ""I can't do anything right"" and it has recently and abruptly changed to ""I'm going to run away"" and the other day she straight up sat down and said ""I'm going to kill myself"" and double-downed on this later.

Well, mental health disorders can develop at 6, even without major trauma.

Perhaps your daughter really is genetically vulnerable to mental health disorders, to the point where even mild punishment can trigger a mental health disorder.

>She essentially says that she would rather be dead so that she doesn't have to deal with her bad feelings/discipline.

Psychologist/therapist etc.

And remove all sharp objects, weapons, anything that could be used to kill herself. 

She's already in suicidal idealation, who knows if she could go further?

>I've of course reiterated the permanence of death and that she can always talk to parents/teachers/friends or whomever she feels comfortable with and we can think of ways to deal with these feelings etc.

She needs professional help, not just parents/teachers/friends.",iyz3t9y,N/A

The correction was suddenly not even part of the conversation. I quickly realized the next time they needed correcting that they played the same card.

I understand that might be difficult as I'm sure you use computer and videos for your homeschooling too. Going scorched earth for a while might help him refocus and get perspective back. Screens and screen addiction are really tough for some kids and it can just be a huge struggle. It might help to step back and consider the big picture of your entire school year... taking a month off of screens might feel like a huge setback but if it saves your year and makes the rest of your time more productive... maybe worth it? In that time you take off screens you could maybe try redirecting his attention into things like educational board games or borrowing a large selection of books on different subjects and see what piques his interest and go from there. And then start slowly reintroducing screens with limits once he seems like he's doing better.

The opposite approach could be to lean into it... I don't know about roblox but minecraft does provide some avenues for creativity and spacial reasoning. Perhaps you could find some way to use this to your advantage? You could agree to let him have more time playing minecraft if he uses that time to say, recreate topography or famous landmarks. Then he'll have to do some research on like the arc de triomphe or whatever in order to build it in minecraft. And maybe you could get him to write some notes on it while he's working on it. A small research assignment perhaps. Idk... I'm sure there's a way you could harness the obsession but I guess it all depends on whether you feel that it's healthy or not.",ix2gndz,N/A

For some kids games are all consuming. I would either 

A. Remove the games completely. Many people find when they remove technology their kids zest for life returns. I would be pretty concerned if my child was so obsessed with just one thing and didn’t find interest in literally anything else. It may be that games are just too addictive for him. 

Or

B. Not allow him to play them until his work is done. If he talks about it instead of focusing then you walk away and leave him with his worksheet (book, activity etc). He needs to know exactly what he needs to complete and be able to check it off so he understands how much work is left until he can play games. If he doesn’t finish his work in a day then no games that day. Be consistent or this will never work. He should also have a set time schedule for when he plays games and watches those videos with the understanding that trying to do them when it’s not time results in loss of privileges. 

Lastly, could he be on the spectrum? Fixated interests can be an indicator of ASD. If this is a concern you should get him evaluated.",ix2f0n1,N/A

Quick description of our scenario:

I'm a 38 year old father. Had two kids from a previous marriage that are now 15 & 13. My girl moved in with her two kids at the very beginning of covid shortly after we had a baby, who is now 2 and a half. Her two previous kids are 10 (boy) and 8 (girl). Their father is basically a non factor -- something I thought would change as he's gotten older and figured things out. Wrong. He sadly still does nothing for his kids. So their mom had basically been raising them with her mom and step dad, who provided a solid foundation, but instilled 0 discipline...something I quickly came to find out shortly after they moved in

When we decided to move in together, I knew there were going to be issues, but it turned out they were a bit deeper than expected. It became clear her kids absolutely ran over their mother in what I would consider extreme ways -- a bit shocking to me at first. We'd been together for 3 years at that point, and while I hadn't spent the most amount of time with her kids, I thought I had a decent feel for them as people: typical spoiled 8 & 6 year olds, not too unlike my own at those ages. Not correct. The extreme tantrums would last 15-30 minutes at a time until they got what they wanted -- to the point the boy would threaten to kill his mom: An 8 year old threatening to kill his mom in extreme anger was a weekly occurrence. I was constantly picking my jaw up off the floor the first 6 months they lived here, with little idea of what to do to solve this problem

Four or five months in to our new living situation, I had had enough. Something had to change. I sat my gf down, and told her her children's behavior was unacceptable, and this can't go on. She agreed, and we decided to make some changes. Come to find out, she was actually scared of her 8 year old son, and wasn't sure if he was displaying psychopathic tendencies. I chuckled and even though some of the behaviors were very concerning, this was not my take on the matter

Over the course of the first 3-5 months, I simply observed how she dealt with them on a moment to moment basis or when they needed some guidance/her foot to come down. To put it simply, it just never happened until she had had enough emotional abuse, and then she'd blow up. To me, it was apparent this was the first thing that needed to change, but the hardest thing for her to hear. She felt guilty about their father not being there for them and so felt the need to continually do everything for them while put up with their constant shit...again until she snapped, then become guilty for getting mad and would console them after she blew up. It's her nature. She's not a loud and overbearing person. She's small and relatively quiet. A bit of a pushover in all honesty

Ultimately, I'm an incentives guy so we agreed on a couple principles:

1. Mom needed to be more consistent
2. We'd instill some notion of negative and positive consequences based on their behavior

We first began limiting video games when behaviors got out of control. This worked relatively quickly with the girl. Her 25 minute tantrums reduced to 2 or not at all. Almost completely cooperative, with rare exception

Not the same for the boy. Immediate explosion. This definitely caused a snowball effect in his behavior. The tantrums got worse, his extreme anger turned to nonchalant f you attitude, and he turned to sneaking and lying, which in turn caused consequences to become harsher and longer. The fighting between all of us skyrocketed. We tried everything from taking away video games, taking away tv, writing sentences, chores, extra chores, and grounding. None of this had any significant impact. This turned into a year of constant, never ending shit between the boy, myself, and the mom. Not only that, but the boy began sneaking devices and anytime he did that would stay up literally all night. He would be so tired he wouldn't go to school. This would happen if not daily, multiple times per week

So a couple months ago, we started looking at how he was being dealt with: still inconsistency, delayed consequences weren't having an impact, and looking at why he was sneaking devices. We came to the conclusion that consequences that were difficult to enforce were not working and were often too long, mom constantly doing things for him that he can do himself was not in his best interest, and we felt he had an addiction -- not necessarily to video games but certain, easy-win Roblox games that basically gamify the child's attention, something I'd warn all parents about. I'm not anti-video games in the slightest, but these 3rd party Roblox games that mine young kids' attention and desire for robux (Roblox money) clearly can become addictive for an impressionable young mind

So, rather than long lasting and delayed consequences, we shifted to a few things:

1. Immediate corner time for bad behavior (5, 10, 15, 30 minutes at a time). No delayed consequences eg have to write 30 sentences ""I will not cuss at my mom"" or something before getting tv back, etc. That's gone
2. We implemented a  two hour window where he had to do something productive for himself before watching tv. Still no video games. We give some structure for the time, but he can choose what he wants to do for himself
3. Turned wifi off for all devices at certain times so even if he sneaks something, he'd be shit out luck for playing the Roblox games all night long
4. Say no to him whenever he asked for help for anything he can do for himself
5. Implemented a much earlier bed time so he can begin going to sleep earlier
6. If he gets scared at night and can't sleep (a common occurrence), to explicitly not sneak, he can wake me up anytime, and we'll figure out how to help him get to sleep

At first, of course there was whining about the two hours of constructive time, but over the course of a couple weeks, he began getting pretty good at drawing!  He'd go outside a bit more, play with the baby, kick the ball around, and he'd be more helpful with things we asked him to do. While he still can't help himself with some of the sneakyness when a device has been left out, most of the time, he's been able to get to sleep before 10pm. And he's come to us when he gets scared, instead of choosing to take a device and stay up all night. His attitude has changed dramatically -- to the point we haven't had a blow up fight in weeks. Win, win, win, win

Yesterday, I gave him back time with the Xbox for the second time in about 6 months or so. He deserves it. His attitude has improved to a point I'd call his behavior ""normal,"" and he seems to have turned a corner with the extreme anger/tantrums -- it's been weeks or longer. We'll see how he behaves now that he had a good chunk of time with the Xbox, and I plan on letting him have some time today once he's done the things he needs to do. But I'm proud of him, and so is his mom. We feel successful in our efforts, and I thought it was worth noting  and celebrating. Let's hope it keeps up",N/A,N/A

From where I sit, this is a recipe for success.  Kids do need rules about their life for them to succeed.  Not onerous rules, but fair rules.  And rewards for successfully applying those rules, and adhering to them.

In something like Roblox they scam kids out of tradeable account items that people will pay real money for. In MMO's they will sell you in-game currency for real life cash...and if you aren't careful they'll ask for too much information and take your account and sell it...or they'll take credit card info and have fun with your card.

Most of these RMT ""farms"" are run out of SE Asian countries and China and are just spambots asking for trades or advertising their services. But there are individual people, all over the globe, that are willing to scam others out of stuff just for kicks...and kids are easy targets.

The BEST thing you can do if your kids are playing an MMO or some other online game like this is to PLAY WITH THEM. That way you are right next to them and can educate them, and yourself, about the dangers of anything along the way. If you don't have time to play with your kids then don't let them play games like Roblox and MMO's.

Minecraft Dungeons. It’s a dungeon exploring game setup in the Minecraft universe.

Paw Patrol has several games if he’s into that show. 

Wobbly Life. You basically explore a fun little world doing jobs/tasks and unlocking costumers and vehicles. I refer to it as GTA for children.

About two years ago when Covid hit I gave my 2 year old a tablet (I KNOW). When Covid came about, my college switched to online only, and his babysitter quit on me. I'm a single mom, and no one in the family would help me, or watch him for me (Okay fair, whatever I guess). At the same time, when school made the online switch, my professors all of a sudden decided that busy work was the way to go. So needless to say, if I wanted to pass I had to find a way to make it happen. 

I was 100% against too much screen time and this boy had TONS of toys and things he could interact with. His main thing has always been my attention though, so he made it impossible to do any schooling, he's never played well by himself. 

He took an immediate liking to the tablet though (because it's like crack to children). Fast forward two yesrs later to today, and now it seems worse. He's either all up in his tablet or all up in my face. There's no in between. He doesn't really play with his toys at all anymore, and he sits there and asks me a million questions a minute about his new obsession he's learned about from his tablet. He's obsessed with Roblox (which is literally the most nerve-wracking thing on the planet to me). If I'm trying to clean, cook, or anything and he doesn't have his tablet he will sit there and purposefully get in my way, or whine until he gets my full, undivided attention.

I feel as if this isn't something a 4-year old is supposed to do (because I was also an only child and I WANTED to play alone and be left-alone to play and be by myself). I feel like the tablet has caused behavioral issues as well. I'm at a loss, and I have no idea what to do.",N/A,N/A

I would take a look at your toy situation and do a toy makeover. It’s not about the amount of toys you have- it’s about whether or not they’re open ended and can lend themselves to long stretches of play- not just something that spins and lights up. Some good ideas for open ended toys: playdough, blocks, toy cars with a racetrack that he can move around and change the shape of, legos, sensory bins that you can add new stuff to periodically. Make a big show of the new play space and then just don’t bring out the iPad again. He may be upset for a while but he’ll get used to it. Also you can totally include a 4 year old in cleaning and cooking - they really like being part of that stuff.",ip792a9,N/A

Where we live we had a 2 month lockdown (no one was allowed outside except to buy food or in an emergency), with schools and nurseries closed from March until September. Everyone who could had to work from home. Our then 3yo ended up getting a lot more tablet and TV time than we had ever wanted, but what could anyone do? As the restrictions came to an end, we started to reduce screen time. This met with resistance and some of that is still around now (but she's a 5yo, so it's understandable).

Apart from parental controls and specifically banning YouTube (including the kids version), we have a ""no tablets on weekdays"" rule and limit tablet time at the weekend to 30-60 mins a day. Which is probably still too much. If there's drama or tears connected to not having the tablet, it's kept out of reach for a week or two (with a clear explanation that we think it's *because* the tablet has been overused that she's reacting like that). She now accepts that it's up to us to decide when ""that's enough tablet time now"".

IMO it's never too late to start reducing screen time and allowing it only at certain moments. So if you need 30 mins to cook supper, let that be the tablet half hour, and no other time during the day. Or put Bluey on TV or something, if he won't do something more creative.",ip7c7af,N/A

Now, if you want, I'd try a timer on the tablet. Say he always uses it for four hours a day - set the timer for 15 minutes less (so 3 hours, 45 minutes) for a couple days. Then do 15 more minutes. Once it times out, it's out. Do this every four to five days until you're at a time limit you're okay with him having.

I'd also recommend going through toys and putting some away. Do you have room to rotate books and toys every week or two to keep it exciting? That might help him become engaged in them again.

It sounds like he's not on a track you want him to be on developmentally, as far as independence, self-sufficiency, and attention. 

However, my 4-year-old has never had a tablet or even held a phone without me also holding it, and I will say cultivating independent play at this age can still be a struggle.

They both talk about roblox all the time. My son is 4 and he has a roblox sweater, backpack for school, roblox stickers all over his door. Anyway the other day after we’ve been cutting back his ipad usage for about a week now, he was in my 8 year old step sons room when he got mad at his game and smashed his ipad. We just bought this for him in june and he destroyed it in october. A new screen is $150 and he doesn’t have money to pay for a new one but we do. I just don’t want him to do this again. This truly breaks my heart that he now can’t enjoy an ipad for anything. I’m worried that he’s going to feel ashamed every time he thinks of roblox, which would be a lot i’m sure. I don’t know what to do. Any advice?",N/A,N/A

No iPad for a while.
He needs to earn a new screen or iPad whatever the damage was.
Christmas is coming and it’s a good way to gift him something.
I’d start thinking of 4yr old chores to do daily to help you around the house.

My boys (11 & 6) are gamers too and I just tell them if they’re too frustrated from a game it’s time to walk away or play a new game. If I notice them freaking out mad at the game or even another player they are done for the day.",itvp3aw,N/A

He’s a leo so he’s fairly demanding and persistent. He wants to do whatever his older brother does, which is play roblox and play on his ipad. Ironically enough, i’ve been off work for the last week and started monitoring his ipad time. Once his brother came back over (we have him one week on and one week off) he wanted to do what his brother did. At his father’s house his 8 year old brother lives on his xbox and ipad with no time monitoring whatsoever. Not my place to say anything, he’s not my child. I told my son he was not allowed to play roblox, (because he’s hit his ipad before getting frustrated with roblox) or watch anything to do with roblox, (because he had bad dreams about us dying and i think he sees this stuff on roblox). This roblox thing is too young for him. I will be making sure he earns his ipad screen and not just getting it as a present. I have been sitting down with him and talking him through his emotions. All while trying to contain mine and the way i talk to him. He is young and if i just give him a new one then he won’t learn his lesson. He actually seemingly doesn’t care or feel bad about it breaking, but then again he just went a few days without it. When he does earn a new screen then he will not have youtube with roblox on it because of where it has older content, and he will not be playing roblox. Also his older brother won’t be playing or watching roblox here when his little brother is around. He’s going to earn money through good behaviour and doing things he has to do, such as brushing his teeth, going to bed nice, not getting worked up about eating supper or getting dressed for school, as well as controlling his bad behaviours by breathing and being nice. I think we’ll be okay with this one. Less ipad means more time we spend together and more educational tv programming. Also i’ve been watching his behaviour and how it correlates with processed sugar. The results aren’t good. Now he gets one treat a day with processed sugar. This could be juice or a yoghurt tube. This will eventually be cut down to once every couple days then less than that. Halloween will be a challenge but i have about a month to work with him until i get back to work fairly steadily, so i think that will be a good enough amount of time to bring in these new habits.

My son, 8, got a message on roblox from his best friend that her mom died this morning. 

Back up a bit.. We had covid this last week so she hasn't been over, but she's here daily. My husband and her mom are the coordinators cuz they're the stay at home parents. We haven't heard from them for about 2 weeks.

Her mom was very sick, malnourished because of digestive issues, had multiple surgeries this summer. Her dad isn't around much, they're together, but he works away from home for weeks/months at a time. He just got back from a job a few weeks ago and E (my son's best friend) was at our house every day even tho her dad had just gotten back after being gone 2 months. I figured it was because her parents wanted together time.

We don't know the dad. We don't know how to get in contact with him (obviously we'll go and knock in a couple days). We don't know E's babysitting situation, usually mom was home but the last few months she's been at our place because her mom has been so weak and tired.

I am at a loss as to how to act. I want to give E a normal, stress free environment. Other kids to play with to keep her mind busy on something else. But again, we dont know her dad. E's mom died this morning, so we are giving their family space, but I want so badly to comfort E right now.",N/A,N/A

My son's are 6.5 and 4. Eldest son has a friend that we have play dates with every once in a while. I know everyone parents differently, I wanted to get others opinions on this.

This friend has a TV in his room and seemingly plays a lot of video games. He plays Roblox and has now introduced Bendy. I have just now gotten my kids Minecraft and they love it. So do I because there is minimal violence and they get to be creative. I told my 6.5 year old he has to wait a few years for Roblox and I keep an eye on what they see on YouTube as long as it isn't inappropriate or violent.

Roblox isn't a bad game and it can be very child friendly but some of the modes also aren't very kid friendly. It can be very minecraft esque in one moment and the next you have kids roleplaying as gangsters and shooting guns at each other. Just ensure to set the parental controls properly before playing. Youtube is a bit different and even with youtube kids there is no guarantee they won't end up on something inappropriate.

I've not heard of bendy, but have had the decision that our 5 year old won't have roblox for some time. Like you say, minecraft is creative- he plays with mobs off. He plays on switch without access to chat functions. He can't access other people's worlds (which might be possible on different platforms). I stand by these decisions. Just like I will block any channel that uses bad language- I let him watch minecraft videos but on the TV with me nearby to monitor.
Just because friend has it doesn't mean they can.
Another thing, we check with friends parents if kids can play minecraft at ours first. You can also ask that the parents restrict access to certain things when your child is in their care.

Alright, so my daughter is almost 8 years old. She is an only child, and with the recent events she can't really go anywhere outside of the house. Since she's been home she's gotten obsessed with her phone. More so then she was before. She wakes up whenever she sees the light of day and is immediately on her phone on Roblox, using the speak to text to try and trade something again. She's always trading, and always crying over people not trading with her or not giving her what she wanted, or straight up scamming her and leaving the server with  her stuff. Last night she begged her father for ice cream, but then sat on her phone while it melted in her hands. When he tried to redirect her attention and have her eat it she started crying because she didn't have her phone for a few moments. Oh my God, I'm gonna die without constant entertainment! 😑

We are losing our minds. We constantly argue with her about calming down with her games, and we also argue about her doing things herself. She's more then capable of sneaking into my room and stealing her phone back (which she did this morning after I took it last night) but refuses to try and brush her own hair. *Sigh* Ok, I think I've ranted enough.. I know it's today's generations toy, it's like their Gameboy persay.. But I need advice. I'm thinking I won't let her have it each day until she's done some things I ask her to do. Chores, behaving, whatever I feel that day. I'm thinking of keeping the phone until around the time she normally would get home from school, or if she completes requested tasks without complaint.

it will take her 2  to 3 weeks to stop begging for screen if you set a restriction. 
My trick is if she whine, beg, and cry for it, she will lose screen time today and tomorrow. I used screen time as a reward if she is behaving good that day. And she will get screen time afternoon.

Go on YouTube and find piano transposes of their favorite songs .  You can usually find some that are beginner friendly, and most YouTubers give their sheet music for free or for sale.

They can also go find music themselves that they might like.  Maybe they don't want to play bach, but like to try Debussy.

Once a week for an hour- okay for some students. It doesn't give them enough time to practice, and, imo compounds the issue of getting stuck on the same piece. 

In my experience, the biggest obstacles to practicing and improvement are: not having a ""fun"" element to their lessons or to their practicing, practicing incorrectly, and trying to practice too much or trying to cram practicing. Shorter amounts of time practicing daily are better than longer amounts occasionally. I would suggest talking to their teacher (if you haven't already) about good practice habits. If they're just playing through the entire piece over and over, for example, it won't help them get better. Lastly, practice sessions should always end with something fun- a piece they have already mastered and enjoy playing, their own composition, a popular song they like, etc.

Her strategy recommendation is to focus on deep connection times together when you’re fully immersed in whatever you’re doing together with firm boundaries around not touching your phone or anything else, and then pulling away clearly for your own time and holding a firm boundary for that time as well. I learned this strategy from her podcast Oh Crap I Love My Toddler But Holy Fuck and I’ve been using it successfully for two years now. It’s not an overnight process, but it was definitely worth the effort because my kid rarely does this anymore. And when he does, it’s usually a sign that I haven’t been focusing enough on our connection times. A little extra focus fills his cup back up and then he’s off to play on his own again.",hyiu04t,N/A

And they love it not because they need anything, but because saying it just makes them feel good. She told me this when my kids were toddler/preschooler. My ears still need a break. They’re 6 and 7. But when I realized they say “Mommy” so much, probably because simply saying my “name” brings them joy, I told myself I needed to suck it up and deal with it like I do all the other things I tolerate to allow them joy. 

With my 6-year-old, I now tell her that my ears need a break and, when she just keeps talking, I look at her and say, “Oh my goodness, words!  SO MANY WORDS!!!!” She gives me a giggle and I get at least 30 seconds of quiet.

I will say though, it’s an educational opportunity to show your kids healthy boundary modelling.  Tell them “daddy needs a break from talking right now, can we talk about your animals a bit later?” Then circle back to it.

Although I note your kid is in the toddler category so this may not be successful so much right now but I guarantee you’ll want to do this a bit later.

With my siblings, when they got to toddler to five years old and older. I would get on their level and say, “Hey, you can I be honest with you? I don’t really feel like talking right now. Can I talk with you later? Maybe give me a bit of time?” Or, “I’m busy with your little sister right now, maybe when Im done, you can ask me again so that I can pay good attention to you?”

It worked for me up until now - I’m 22 now and they act like they’re too cool to talk to me, so whatever. But it’s how I got through my days. Now, I’m much more talkative and kinda love being around chatty kids. I was babysitting 4 kids 24/7 for a few months in 2020 - live in nanny - 5 yr old girl, 7 yr old girl, and 4 mo old twins - and when I needed a break I would tell them just that. But they LOVED to talk and talk and talk and honestly, I didn’t mind it because they’re questions were a lot easier than the questions I got while working at Verizon.

My son is a talker to the extreme. I value that it has led to some awesome conversations between us, but I do a few things that I think helps me maintain sanity:  
  
-If he’s talking about something I’m not interested in, or talking just to hear himself talk, I try to give him my full attention FOR A FEW MINUTES. If I’m half-listening, I find he talks more and more because he’s trying to get my attention. If I give it, he usually gets to the point or realizes he doesn’t have anything else to say. His need for attention is satisfied and he stops. If he doesn’t, I find a stopping point and say “thank you for telling me about that. I would like to have some quiet time right now, but we can talk more later!”  
-Reminders about what a conversation is. Sometimes kids talk us about things we aren’t interested in, and it’s important to listen. THAT SAID, kids need to be taught that a conversation is a back and forth conversation. You need to have room to give input or ask questions. “That’s interesting; so what do you like about that dinosaur?” If they aren’t giving you that room, it’s not a conversation.  
-In a similar thread, they need to learn that while you value their interests, you may not share them. My son learned this the hard way when he kept asking me what my favorite sport car was, and I kept responding, “I don’t know any thing about sport cars and I don’t care to ever own one. I respect that you are interested in them, please respect that I’m not.”  
  
Anyway, these things have helped us have more conversations and fewer “I’m being talked at and I’m dying inside” moments.",hyiqpey,hyiimbk

As it turns out, it was a coping mechanism. I (30f) found out earlier this year that I’m both autistic and ADHD. And my whole family is neurodiverse, so to them, it was just normal.

My 10 year old seems to be interested in playing Minecraft and says that he would be interested in getting into tinkering and modding.  I've tried to setup Minecraft environment to do modding but it seems a bit complicated for him and gets bored to follow through.  I've tried to teach him using scratch but I think that again it was a bit boring and we stopped working through the book.  

I think joining a club or a camp would be more fun for my son and they will have an educational program to follow.  

I found some services with online classes but would like to get some suggestions from personal experience for sites that offer live classes for kids or maybe online clubs that my son can join.  It could be anything (beginner) from Minecraft, programming or electronics projects, 3D printing.

He has had two pee accidents (never had them before) because I think he holds it because he is not used to 6 hour days. VPK was only 3 hours. The teacher is working with him and we had no accidents yesterday. 

Yesterday was his first day with homework. He complained the whole time. I made homework very positive and tried to make it fun but it didn’t work.

Any tips? How can I get him excited for school? I will be rewarding him $10 a week in Roblox if he does his homework.",N/A,N/A

Honestly, i never made mine do it, not in kindergarten.  I always attempted to do it with them but if they were tired or burnt out or particularly fussy about it, i didn't force it. To me, that's a lot to ask of a kindergarten kid everyday, school and homework.  My kids did just fine in school (ones an adult who went onto college, one is in college and neither of my middle school aged ones fell behind). I never had any of their teachers say anything about not getting their homework in everyday. And i didn't have issues with them in the older grades doing their homework (beyond the normal amount) It's just a battle i refused to have at that age.

For the rest of it, he's having a hard time adjusting, that's normal at this age. Offer lots of comfort and hugs and it will probably pass in a week or two.  If it doesn't I'd revisit the issue but remember they pick up on our anxiety so try not to fuss on him too much.",ilh03lo,N/A

But man, homework, that sucks. Our school just started a new curriculum that is more play based and zero homework. They realized how much the previous model was failing the kids. Unfortunately there’s not too much you can do about that at this point. I’d take homework in small steps. It’s kindergarten, if he doesn’t finish it, so what at this point.

In the United States, the accepted guideline, which is supported by both the National Education Association and the National Parent Teacher Association, is the 10-minute rule: Children should have no more than 10 minutes of homework each day for each grade reached starting in 1ST GRADE. Kindergarten = ZERO homework. ZERO. Asking you to practice tying shoes with your kid is one thing. Asking you to read ONE book with your kid each night, no big deal. Sending home MULTIPLE worksheets is completely different and I would straight up decline that so fast it would make their head spin.

I would take a printout of the homework guideline to the principal of the school and ask point blank why your KINDERGARTEN child is being given FOUR WORKSHEETS of homework.... and no matter what they say you tell them ""We opt out of Kindergarten homework, thank you have a nice day."" <exit>",ilhbkez,N/A

Add-on to [this post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/wh1l4v/well_that_escalated_quickly/)

So we seem to have inadvertently adopted my kid's ""girlfriend"".  She came over this weekend and never really left: they played Roblox and video games, sometimes they watched the toddler while I did the laundry or the dishes. This weekend was my toddler's birthday so we invited her to come to the zoo with us (my kid has always been allowed to bring a friend, as he's well beyond the ""let's put the rocks down and look at the monkey"" phase) and somehow that morphed into a sleepover and then she fell asleep on our couch again for the third time in two days and by the time I sent her home she'd spent 30 hours with us. Even our dog has stopped growling at her, and if you know our dog, you know that's a big thing.

And I kinda had the impression that she still did not want to go home.  I wouldn't have a problem with letting her stay longer if we'd arranged it with her parents, but our agreement was for this one night.  But I also suspect that we're dealing with a situation that's in that gray zone between ""different parents, parenting differently"" and some level of neglect.  I'm not the motherly type.

I'm so scared 

I have an 11 year old son with ADHD. It's been difficult to say the least. Right now I don't want to have a drink, or get high and forget about all my problems. I just want to do what I have to to make sure my son thrives in this world. But it's so hard. And my best just isn't good enough. I stress constantly about the quality of life he will grow into. 

Nothing motivates him. Not rewards or punishment. I don't believe in hitting kids. But my patience is constantly being put to the test. 

He has a issue with keeping his room clean and I told him he had to straighten up or he would get bugs. And he had to put all his dishes away in the kitchen. We went back and forth about it because he wanted me to do it for him and said I had no reason not to. I turned off his console and he got really upset and swatted a bowl to the ground and was yelling at me. He got in trouble and I sent him to bed early. Most recently we have had to deal with him losing control of his emotions. In school he got into a tussle with another student because the other student broke something of his. (From what he described it was a toy or something) but i don't think it was the whole story because other boys were involved and he didn't tell me how. 

That same day while he was at school I looked at his YouTube account and saw he was on his phone at all hours, Sometimes 3 and 4 am, and last week he started making comments cursing at people saying things like ""That S is Fing gay"" and things of that nature. He also has mentioned Andrew Tate. Which was really concerning for me. I have told him to stay away from that content and why it's wrong. 

I took away his phone (except during school hours since he doesn't use it there) and allowed him to at least call his friend on the weekend. I also put some more secure parental locks and restrictions on his phone. That was last week. And now today, I come into his room and someone starts yelling over and over again, horrible words, every bad word you can think of. The N word (hard ER) Sh*t, fu*k, b*tch. Just saying them over and over again. Apparently it's someone his friend from school knows. And when I asked him why didn't he just leave the room? He said it's none of his business, ""why do I care, I'm not his dad"". I asked if this happens all the time and he said yes. I sat him down and I explained to him why I was upset and it was the last straw and I was going to have to really make some changes. 

So far I have been trying gentle parenting. His punishments so far have been doing things like writing in a journal (which he hates doing because it's boring) and spending more time with his family. Doing his own laundry. When he is done with his chores, I say he can still play on his PlayStation but I limit it to 2 hours on weekdays. 

Video games is the one thing he really likes to do. I'm currently trying to find him some activities like tournaments he can train and participate in and maybe videogame testing for cash. He also started a YouTube page, I help him with edits and even make some of my own for his page, and I'm researching some streaming equipment to gift him for Christmas (but after the incident I said he had to cool it for a while on YouTube) and while I don't agree or like the constant focus on video games, I don't want to squander his passions and I do what I can to encourage him. And I thought it wasn't hurting him. But now I'm not so sure. 

So I told him that I was at the end of my rope and this is my last resort and after I told him no phone and no PS5 until his He started yelling and screaming, he was clearly having a panic attack. I tried to calm myself down, calm him down, offered him cold water and breathing exercises, he was really defiant he just lost control. I tried to call his dad but he got even more upset. He was crying and yelling and screaming and hitting the chair (which I told him not to do) saying ""why me?"" ""I should of done so and so"" crying and saying he just wanted to play Roblox with one of his other friends (they have been online friends for some years, I'm actually planning a trip so they can finally meet, my son thinks of him as his brother) I even told him he can have one more night but tomorrow thing are going to change. He couldn't accept that. He kept crying, hyperventilating, begging me not to take his phone or his PS. 

I understand his has ADHD (he does take medication, but I'm going to call his dr and see if we can explore getting it readjusted, I'm thinking with him going through puberty and hormones it might not be enough anymore. He just can't focus) I know all that comes with it includes a low frustration tolerance, difficultly with hygiene (I'm not sure he probably bathes himself. Sometimes he just sits in the shower) and lack of motivation (I'm not sure if it's the right way to say that but i have read it's hard for people with ADHD to focus on goals and achieve them) but it's not really an option to just give up on teaching him. While I do have help I struggle to find a stable income. Getting him involved in activities like kids football or karate cost money that I can't really afford to spend right now. (I'm saving for trade school) and I don't really know how else to keep him occupied at home without him complaining about being bored to tears. 
I know it will all come with time but I'm still scared for the future. What if he doesn't get it? What if he hurts someone? What if he loses his temper at the wrong time with the wrong person and ends up dead or in jail? And as a black young adult everyone knows the statistics there. 

When I tell you I want to cry right now but I still feel so numb. I don't know what else to really do. While forcing him to do anything seems wrong I know that I can't do nothing. I will say I never wanted to be a parent and this is why. Raising humans is not easy at all. Raising disabled black boys is even harder. One hand people say ""his mama should of whooped his ass"" and the other says ""boys need love and consideration"" and you can't really do both. 

I believe I also have ADHD and I don't know how I would have wanted to be parented in this type of situation. I don't want him to hate me but I'm slowly accepting that no matter what I do or how I do it I'm going to be the villain. I am really dreading the teenaged years. I don't want to break his spirit but his spirit is very much an jerk at this point. There is more to this story but I'm getting tired of feeling like I'm bad mouthing my kid. He fell asleep which is expected and I guess I'm just venting right now.",N/A,N/A

Okay so my daughter wants to play one of these games, she's not fussed which one but I want something that she can play solo without interacting with others for the time being.

She's only six and I don't think she needs the social side of things atm.

I'm also mindful of in app purchases as I don't want to be spending money here there and everywhere.

Which one better fits our requirements?

I don't mind an initial one off expense but I won't be able to keep up with a monthly thing indefinitely, especially when my other kids get older.

The normal mode is single player mode, and in order to play on servers, she would have to know the server's IP. So it's pretty safe in that regard. 

It's also a one-time expense, with the price sitting at around 25 bucks, if I remember correctly. It's not a monthly subscription, and you have access to pretty much all features without paying extra money for anything. 

I got Minecraft for my (now 11 year old) son when he was 5, and we haven't really had any issues with it. Just make sure to enforce screen time rules, since the game definitely has some addictive potential, especially at that age. I'd say 45 minutes per day are fine. This will be the biggest issue you will have, especially since Minecraft is fun and it can be hard to stop after her screen time is up. However, it's important that she has screen time rules and can't just play all day. Make sure she knows this, and don't give in if she asks for more gaming time afterwards.

Minecraft is a great game, it encourages creativity, especially due to its open-world nature. You can even turn off the monsters (and make it harder / almost impossible for her game character to die) if that's still too scary for her.

Good luck :)",fzz7ax0,N/A

I sometimes spend hours playing it, myself as it is hard to put down once you have that ""let's build this right here with these blocks!"" Idea in your head.

my 7 year old has a phone that she can only use when shes home (only on wifi) for data. She started playing Roblox which i thought was an innocent game since she said all her friends at school play it too. I like to randomly look through her phone to see what shes doing and whos shes talking to (usually my mom or my dad). We were going out to dinner last night and i asked to see her phone and once i went on Roblox and saw that they have a convo section, she freaked out, literally jumping into the front passenger seat where i was and screaming for me to give her phone back. This brought me into a panic thinking what the hell can be on this phone. The conversations were normal hello and what are you doing but god knows who these people are. She said they do dating on this game and they only hug. I told her how people play these games and pretend to be kids and are actually adults who will try to talk bad or try to meet you. I thought this was an innocent kid game until i really started looking into it.

I actually had to block roblox for my son quite a while back because we had set up a child account and he found out from a friend how to create his own account.

I believe the company behind it has tried to take various steps to create a safe environment, but like most internet games, it's not going to be enough to be truly safe for unsupervised play for young kids.

Since you mention a phone, a helpful tool you might want to look into is Circle by Disney. Roughly $100, it's a device you plug into your home network and it allows you to control internet access for all devices on your network, and have a lot of easy to use, fine grained control over specific game services and such. It might help your situation.

It's been helpful to me, because 100% supervised play is just not a reality for parents, so these tools help to keep some controls for young kids to be within configured bounds.

It's not really useful for older kids because they'll find ways around it, but it's helpful for younger kids.

Now with technology and the Internet, if we're not informed and careful as parents, giving them an Internet-connected device is akin to dropping them off at night on Bourbon St. New Orleans during mardi gras and saying ""be safe, see you tomorrow"".

Youtube is a big one because it's so popular, but due to it not being curated content, it's a real mine field. The restrictions and controls available for that are laughable, as with any platform where the content isn't curated. There's a restricted mode, but my understanding is that only applies to content that has either been flagged by the uploader or reported and flagged by youtube, which isn't enough. There was a youtube kids they launched, but the content is basically for around kindergarten age, of no interest to older kids and tweens.

The mom will not listen to me or his dad on this, and continues to let him play it. I really wish he wouldn’t play it at all, it scares me.

I probably caused this for the most part, by spoiling her and her brother who is 6 years old. I don't even know how or when this started but I can't handle it anymore. Every time I go to the store she expects me to get her a toy. She plays a game on her ipad, well she plays roblox & toca boca. She always asks me ""how many days until you get paid"" so I can buy her something on either roblox or toca boca, even though some of the stuff is only $3 I tried explaining to her she doesn't need to know when I get paid and she doesn't need to constantly get stuff on her ipad.

She complains constantly, her brothers birthday in thursday, she's going to cry and whine that she's not getting anything and he gets more stuff than her. I don't know what to do anymore. Nothing is good enough for her, she acts like shes a teenager and shes only 5. I never had a mom in my life growing up so I feel like I must be doing this whole parenting thing wrong. My dad was never in my life either, my grandma has always spoiled me so maybe that's why I've gotten my kids more stuff than they need. 

I had a really hard time bonding with my daughter when she was born, I was still struggling with depression from after my son, but I obviously have always loved her but I'm struggling with bonding with her still. Me and my son has always had a strong bond and it makes me feel horrible that she literally drives me insane with her needs.

What you haven't said is how you respond to complaining and whining (and presumably having tantrums) constantly. Your response to this is going to be important in (well mine anyway) a response. 

Draw your line. Make your expectations clean. Set boundaries.... then stick to them. Never... ever... cave or compromise. ""One thing and that's it."" then do the one thing and nothing else. Don't negotiate with terrorists (is my favourite term when talking about dealing with children). 

Im sorry that your early life kinda sucked; and from experience I know how that parlays into overcompensation and spoiling of one's kids. But you're not doing _yourself_, or her to be honest, an favours by not setting reasonable expectations and enforcing limits. 

Next time, before you get her anything, sit her down. ""Hey. ITs Tuesday, that means we go to the store. When we get there, I will get you _ONE_ <thing she wants>. But that's it until next Tuesday and I mean it. No tantrums no complaining"". And then do not under any circumstances go back on that until next Tuesday. If you do this two or three cycles in a row and hold to your restriction (and promise) then Im willing to bet it goes away. 

But during those first few cycles... you're in for a rough time. Whining, complaints. ""Im sorry, I said ONE, you got ONE, that's it until Tuesday."" Be prepared for how you handle a tantrum. My advice: ignore her completely. If she wants to flop on the floor and throw stuff and act like... err.. a 5 yr old having a tantrum, ignore her (I mean, like make sure she doesn't hurt herself, but otherwise..). WHe she gets in your face and screams in your ear, calmly turn to her and say ""Im sorry you feel that way but you're not behaving very nicely. Come back to me when you're willing to behave nicely and not scream in my ear."" Gonna be tough, but it will bear fruit.

This will sound rather cold, but I think its appropriate: as a parent your job isn't to be your child's best friend. If your child winds UP being your best friend, that's a bonus. And of course Im not saying not to love your child to the moon and back and show it every minute of every day. But your job isn't to cater and pamper their every need and whim. Your job is to get them to adulthood. And lead by example. And part of that is learning there are rules and limits and expectations and boundaries. Giving them everything they want when they want isn't going to teach them to be anything but needy, helpless codependent whiners.

edit: another thing as I come back to this a few hours later. You're the parent. Don't feel the need to ever explain or justify any rule or decision to your kids. Just keep it simple. ""Sorry, we can't afford it."" What are they gonna do, audit the books? or ""No. I said no. That's all you need to know. Is no."" or... and this actually worked with my kids: ""Yep I said so. Completely arbitrary reason. Guess what. Im the adult, I get to make up arbitrary rules, Im the parent. Deal with it. When you're the adult you get to make arbitrary rules for you kids. Circle of life. Go ask grandma and grandpa they'll tell ya the same thing. They made arbitrary rules that I thought sucked when I was your age. So Im just passing the buck onto you."" <- I like this one because it shows you acknowledge the unfairness (i.e. acknowledge their pain.. shows _empathy_)... you just don't care.",i3dn243,N/A

Sit her down and tell her that you want to teach her and her brother lessons about being thankful for the things she has and that you won't be buying anything new for her or her brother unless it's necessary (school stuff, for example) or a special occasion (birthdays, Easter, whatever). When she whines and cries and throws a fit remind her, ""This is one of those lessons. Instead of buying something new, let's talk about the cool things we already have!"" You'll like get something about how nothing she owns is cool and then it's time to bring out the big black bags... ""OK. When we get home, we'll put all the stuff you think isn't cool in big black garbage bags and get it out of your room. We're still not buying anything new though."" 

I'd also remind them of expectations, and put consequences to the actions. Let them know before you go into the store each time, ""We're not buying toys today. We're only buying groceries."" Or before playing Roblox, ""You can play, but if you ask me about payday or buying things, the game is going away."" Then follow through.

It sounds like your daughter is trying to get something from you.

But it might be positive to shift the perspective and give more importance to time spent together, etc... Maybe also to tell her why you appreciate and love her as a person, why she is valuable, and slowly start shifting the narrative you have that you can only provide things and that she needs those things.

No means no. It will be rough on you while she gets used to the seriousness of the situation, but it will get better over time. 

With my kid, his dad has a tough time setting boundaries because he hates seeing him upset. I think of it as some growing pains now for an easy pay off later.

However, one 'positive parenting' technique that always helped a bit with my son was sort of acknowledging the wishes for things he wanted to do or buy and even expanding on them into silly fantasy ('yeah, that would be awesome, huh? It'd be fun to stay at the playground and slide all night long, even until tomorrow! Or maybe live at the the playground! Where would you sleep?') and taking pictures of items he liked in stores ('We aren't buying anything today, but do you want me to take a picture of it? That would be cool to have, huh? It'd be fun if we bought every single toy in the store but then we wouldn't have room to walk in our house!'). But if he was deciding to be stubborn and tantrum about it, then it was just go sit outside the store for a few minutes until he calmed down.   


Also your daughter doesn't need to know about your money situation. It'll sound like too much money if you have a lot and it'll stress her out too much if you don't have enough. And you don't need to justify your decisions to her based on finances - you're the mom and you just get to decide what you want to do. :)",i3f2n4d,N/A

Sit a the table and tell her that the money you make must take care of your families’ needs first. Tell her to play with what she has and to quit comparing her possessions to others.

This is actually a very good opportunity to teach her economics, responsibility, and consequences. 

Economics: If she wants stuff, she can start doing chores around the house for a little bit of cash. A dollar or so a day to get her list checked off. Find a list of age appropriate chores she can do and pay her at the end of the week.

Responsibility: She can pay for the things she wants or she can save up for it. 

Consequences: If she doesn't do her chores, she doesn't get paid.

Shut it down at the first complaint. This means consistency. Stop whatever is happening and make it abundantly clear. Tantrums need to be addressed immediately and it could mean abruptly going to the car until she’s ready to stop causing a scene. Teaching breathing exercises to help her control her emotions is helpful. Expressing emotions is ok but she needs to know there is a time, place and appropriate way to do so. 

It sounds like a lot for her age but children are smart, resilient and react well to firm, consistent behavior by adults. I’ve raised three and these tactics worked even for stubborn kids. 

She needs to know that she doesn’t get gifts when it isn’t her birthday or celebration. It’s important she understands it now. The more you reiterate it without feeding into the drama, she will learn.

Explain to her that she has to be a good sport. It’s his birthday so she can be happy for him and ask him nicely if she can play WITH him or she can sit in her room. Whining isn’t an option. 

I think you need to have a chat with her and her brother and explain some new rules. My mom had a rule when I was growing up called “I will not complain.” Essentially it was a nicer way to say “you get what you get and you don’t throw a fit.” You need to be grateful for the things you are getting because not everyone gets those opportunities. If you act like a spoiled brat, you lose your privileges to “extra” things like playing Roblox. 

I’m not sure what your life looks like outside of this but you might want to start making an effort to replace money with quality time. Family walks, little hikes, a trip to the zoo or aquarium, a “girls day” to get hot chocolate and then drive around and look at ducks on the lake, etc. are all fun and free/inexpensive. Spending more time together helps build relationships. It’s super easy to just throw money at people and “buy” relationships but an unplugged walk makes you all talk a little bit and learn about each other.

Kids need to be prepared to become adults. Part of that is understanding that things cost money and money comes from labor.

There are ways to say no without saying no. Maybe you can give her $5/month for digital content. She gets it on the first of the month. Meanwhile she can use a journal to write down the ones she likes.

If my son complained about another's birthday gifts, I would suggest he start making some plans for his birthday (or pick a school end present, or a Christmas present, etc). Or I would remind him of something nice he's got coming his way like a playdate with a friend. 

I tell my son beforehand not to expect a toy when we go to the store. If he really likes something then I take a picture of it. I have followed up so he does trust me. For example he likes the model toy car displays at the pharmacy and we do sometimes have to go. So I took a picture of one when with him , but then bought it and gave it to him a couple weeks later when he got his report card. It is a simple thing but I want him to be acknowledged and also to look forward with hope and also to be proud of the things he accomplishes. 

I too am very annoyed when my son asks for stuff but it is normal. I don't give in but I feel almost hurt when he keeps asking like he just doesn't appreciate me or our home.

So I take my girl to charity shops (thrift stores) quite often (1-2 a week). I don't mind buying slightly random toys from there and I do mind buying new plastic crap. But the rule is 1 thing, and I get final approval. I make some arbitrary decisions about ugly, loud or just useless tat without explaining them. After about a year of this, there's no argument any more. In fact she actively won't let me buy her more than 1 thing! It's clear that what she enjoys is the process, and we're now introducing the 'one in one out policy'. She's 3.5 so a 5 year old is very capable of learning this. 

But if the rules aren't predictable or you have tied the rule to something else (like when you get paid), kids struggle. So set up a rule-  how much money can she spend on games in a week. Keep it fixed, give it to her on the same day, make a big deal of it but do not give any more. Same with toys. For the birthday party, talk to her about it. Remind her of her party, ask who got the presents, does she remember what she got, wasn't it great. Then turn it round - you know your brother will get all the presents because it's his day, he's going to be so excited. Maybe give her a responsibility for the party.

Just wanted to say though, the fact that you're asking for help means you are a great mom. You care. You're probably trying to fill a void from your childhood, so it's understandable. And none of us know your parenting styles outside of this one issue. So all of those judging really don't have a rock to stand on.  

With the bonding thing, maybe counseling will help? Not all kids/parents need to have a super strong bond. Some are just vastly different personalities. Just love her and try and find some things in common, and be a good parent.  Bonds come and go as they age. 

And Roblox has an option to do a direct monthly withdrawal. I do $5 for my 9 year old every month for helping feed/water/letting out the dogs. That way he never asks outside of that monthly deposit.

Something to add though, I’d start being unfair. It sounds mean, I know. I’ve done this with my 5 kids and now as teens/older children it’s served them well. 

What I mean by this is basically if I’m out shopping without kids and see something I like for 1 kid, I buy it for just the one kid and give it to them in front of the others. Next time I grab something for someone else. And repeat over time. My mantra is “Life isn’t fair and I wouldn’t be doing you any favours raising you to think it ever is. What goes around always comes back around and you will get your turn soon.” This way my kids don’t expect to get something when others get something. They don’t get sad at bday parties. They don’t have a false sense of entitlement. They’re genuinely happy for each other when they get something cool. This takes time and patience and possibly tears in the beginning but it’s well worth it.",i3eczdw,N/A

OP This!

And the 'as a parent your job isn't to be your child's best friend.' part. 

Your goal is to raise a functioning happy adult. Some bumps on the way are fine. Major issues need attention. I understand where you are coming from. Your grandmother raised you with gifts. Her generation suffered a lot, and she probably wanted to make sure you never feel the way she did growing up during the Great Depression. Her intentions were different. You live in a world of constant spending. The hard part for parents is not to afford gifts due to scarcity. Rather we need to help kids understand over indulgence and the abundance of 'wants' we face. Self control and self understanding will be the gift you give your kids because that is the modern challenge.",i3e12wf,i3dn243

Nothing else. You’d be surprised how quickly 5 year olds understand money! (At least mine did - they got $10 a month each, and a quick math lesson on how much that was per day). To be honest, I still do this, but now they get much bigger amounts (at 11& almost 10), and because they know how to budget, they are responsible for clothing purchases, gifts, and extras.

We just instituted an allowance for both of mine.  It's $1 per year of age per week.  So the 4 y/o gets $4 per week, the 6 y/o gets $6 per week.  And they have to split it between Spend (to spend on whatever they want), Save (saving up for a goal) and Giving (giving to a charity or helping others).  The 6 y/o puts $2 in each jar.  the 4 y/o puts $1 in each jar and then puts her extra dollar where ever she wants.  Every other week they each pay a $1 tax as well that goes into a family jar to pay for a fun family thing (like Saturday ice cream or a movie).  

This has greatly cut down on the whining for things because if they want something, they have to use their $$ to get it.  My 4 y/o is a saver so she rarely spends all her spend money, but the 6 y/o spends it as soon as he gets it.  But then he knows he doesn't get anything else until the next week.  

(For money they get as gifts, they can choose where to put it.  Surprisingly, it's often Save).",i3dwwc1,i3dlm2o

My son doesn't get an allowance but he also rarely comes to the shops with us either (mostly due to the routines we have now with working from home and COVID). So I'll spontaneously buy him a hotwheel occasionally if he's with me, but even if he came every week he wouldn't get one. 

Actually the hotwheel display at the grocery store was a good exercise in trust; it is on the end of the aisle, and he'd want to look at them so I'd allow him to stay there and go a little further down the aisle, or just around the end cap and back, etc (more and more as he got older). He showed I could trust him to stay there, which made him very proud. I eventually allowed him to choose one to buy (I think once I could trust him while I got milk; in line of sight but a few low displays away).

Her excitement was squashed when my wife got upset that she was talking to strange men, and what were they talking about (in an accusatory tone), when I tried to discuss it, I essentially got yelled at, and my daughter ran off in tears.

Your not going to be able to cover her indefinitely from assholes on the internet, but slowly you can build up her confidence so that the effects of bullies is minimalized.

Neither of those are exclusively YouTube issues. Also both are things she'll have to learn to manage by herself sooner or later.

On the flipside, you have a child who is passionate about a creative activity and taking their cue from you about how to shape their relationship with it. This could be the beginning of a lifelong hobby or even a career. Or it could just be a brief exploration or fad. There's no way of knowing, but creativity is a nice thing to encourage.",i870pii,N/A

This stuff is terrible for the mental health of the people involved. It's not even like this is new and unstudied ground. We already know. The research has been done and the life stories of these people has been told.

This is awful for our brains.

If she has a passion for making edits, great, make them! Be creative! Make art!

Challenge yourself to make better and better art. Try new methods. Experiment with new techniques. Use new tools to open new creative doors. I love it.

But under no circumstances would a child of mine be presenting that stuff to the outside world via YT or some other unmoderated venue that we already know is destructive, exploitative, and used by creeps.

\- Make the art.

\- Display to a real and safe audience. (Family, friends, and pre-screened people who are also in the community of art creation that she's in.)

My daughter (10 y/o) has been playing Roblox for a year. Couple of months ago, she asked if she can use real money ($10) to buy some Roblox money and we obliged to it. Then about 3 months ago, the same thing happened and we said yes to it again. 

&nbsp;

Yesterday, she asked again if she can have some real money to buy Roblox money... So I am a bit hesitant because I don't really want her to be using money to buy stuff in Roblox. If she asked for money and she buys (eg. something in Target), I would be happy to do it.

&nbsp;

Let say I tell her that she can get some money if she does some chores. Still, there is something with using money for Roblox that seems to bother me. Here are my questions:

1. Am I just being nuts for not letting her use real money in Roblox?
2. Should I tell her that she needs to ""earn"" the money and she can use it however she wants?",N/A,N/A

I don't know if I am alone in having a Wii at home, to have an active alternative to my 9-year-old kid Daniel. As he is getting older pokemon go has been my new clutch. Not that he isn't still playing outside a lot but games just seem to be more of a motivator. I feel like the time I used playing outside was a vital part of my upbringing. So that leads me to where I am now, with 2 solutions: Number 1 is I have been finding ""cool"" active toys and games for the outside spikeball and wavebord has been a great success for having a good balance not getting to ""kid"" and still being active.

Number 2 is the reason I'm writing here looking at active games and other active digital experiences. I would love it if any of you guys have some active gaming alternatives that I don't know of. Looking for motivator to replace just some of the ""Fortnite time"".

This is my current list sorted by my requirement (having a small living room):

Wii: The best indoor way to give him an alternative to Fortnight and Roblox

Switch: for one Fortnight and Minecraft are kings on the switch and I did buy Ring Fit Adventures but the game felt more like a chore and fell out of favor fast. Also, have to Switch Sports and it is a mixed bag dependent on who is playing and how much energy me and Daniel have.

Bought a lot of promising products:

Playfinity ball: Was cool in the start and if your kid loves throwing and catching a ball you might have a better result, but Daniel got bored after a couple of weeks.

WRDLS ball: This was the biggest letdown loved the concept but the delivery was really bad. The games were both buggy, unfinished, and not fun

UDU Console: This is the latest project I backed. The game's graphics look a bit shit in my opinion, but the concept seems interesting at least. If it delivers it also seems like a cool piece of hardware.

Also looked at other pokemon go like games (Daniel loves RPG like games):

The Witcher: Monster Slayer: was a bit realistic in the graphics and couldn't and just worse than pokemon go

Orna: Orna is a great time sink for anyone who likes RPG, but it is a slow and stats-heavy RPG. We played it together for a couple of months and will still pick it up at times

VR: I would love to have VR but it is a bit too expensive and I don't have the space for it

My son is almost 10. He has a group of friends (all his grade, about 5-6 of them, a couple of girls included) that he feels SO close with the past six months or so. Lately he has been more hermit-like... hiding out in his room on calls/FaceTimes with his friends, playing video games like Roblox and Fortnite. I had chalked up his newfound ""independence"" to typical maturing... however, my husband and I keep a pretty close eye on what he's saying in chats (texts/messages via Messenger Kids) and we've noticed that a specific 2 or 3 of the friends send messages with inappropriate language in them, as well as screen-sharing inappropriate videos (no nudity or anything overtly graphic, but a lot of implied sexuality). The couple of times I've witnessed my son watching their screen shares, I've told him it's time to get off the call, and he immediately hangs up. When scrolling through the texts/chats, my son almost never responds, but I know he's reading them. I've caught him saying the ""f"" word and he even asked to have a sip of my beer one weekend???

These kids are his best friends, and they consider themselves a ""club"" at school. I just can't shake the fact that I think they're steering him the wrong way, robbing him of his innocence in a way. He's at an age where I feel like I can still have an influence on the type of kid he wants to become, but am I overstepping my boundaries by somehow discouraging these friendships? How would a parent even be able to have an impact in this situation, at his age? He's already involved in basketball and piano after school.

I do know these kids' parents, but not well. The communication we have is about the kids' logistics when they all hang out. From everything I know, they seem like great people. Do I need to bring this up to them or just stay out of it? Ah! So confused... please help me, seasoned parents.",N/A,N/A

I wouldn’t be alarmed about a kid dropping a swear word, it’s pretty typical. I would have conversations about appropriateness. You don’t tell someone to ‘F off’ and you are mindful of your language to be respectful.

My parents weren't that involved with what I did in my free time (essentially screen time), so I spent most of my time playing video games. I definitely would have preferred it if they tried to  manage my time after looking backon it, but I grew out of it on own and I'm now a perfectly fine student in highschool. 

If you're not already familiar, ""Adopt Me"" is a game where kids can pretend to have families (something of the sort - in terms of appearance it's harmless). A LOT of kids play this game, and I'm pretty sure it's the most popular game on the site. This may give you some false pretenses, but if you think about it, a lot of games out there have many inappropriate ideas in the real world (i.e., shooting people), and it's essentially the same here. 

I personally think it would be extremely uncomfortable for her if you were overly assertive (like others are recommending to be) with stopping her. I think it's better to expose to her more healthy hobbies. We all have weird things we liked to participate in, but it's something that most of us tend to grow out of. Admittedly, if my parents found out about all the stuff I've seen/played, they'd think I'm crazy. But look at me now - I'm a healthy student with great grades and I look back on my past and laugh a bit. Monitor her, but most importantly don’t turn a blind eye.

I did not allow it when my kid was around 7 or 8, but I would be ok with it at age 10. Because the games are user-created, there are a lot of lame, time-wasting games, as well as some games that are not exactly kid-friendly. For example, there are creepy horror games, and way too many prison-break-themed games. Hopefully at 10 yo, your kid is mature enough to browse away from inappropriate games.",fgkx6oa,N/A

So, to start off with a little context I’ve recently come under fire from my current SO’s ex who he shares a child with. They have 1 boy (6) and I have 3 boys (3, 7, 12). 
My 12 and my 7 year old like horror games. Nothing crazy - think Poppy Playtime and Five Nights at Freddy’s. 
Their son is autistic - doesn’t like scary things and has nightmares. 
My kids try hard to be considerate of this by not allowing him to watch and my 7 year old even keeps his scarier plush toys at his fathers home instead of mine. Sometimes their son try to get my 7 year old to let him watch and he’s pretty adamant about not letting him see or says why don’t we play something less scary on Roblox. 
My kids don’t have nightmares and they know that these things aren’t real and it’s just for fun. My oldest once wanted to watch the Conjuring and got scared and said nope this is freaking me out so we turned it off. I don’t make them watch/play scary things and there is plenty off limits and if I felt these games were messing with them I’d for sure ban them as well. 
Anyways, his ex has been upset saying that I’m a bad parent and disgusting person because I allow my kids to play these games. It’s pretty hurtful even though I feel like I understand my children’s feeling and if it was affecting them negatively I’d act accordingly. And we do everything we can to accommodate the comfort of their child who feels things differently and I totally get that. 
She’s even made digs while I was at her home saying what kind of awful people let their kids play this stuff, knowing damn well I do. 
The thing I don’t get is she allows him to play stuff like Among Us, which you literally kill people and and try to lie your way out of getting caught, which seems just as bad to me. There is actual depiction of being shot, eaten, or chopped in half too. And Poppy Playtime (the one she really seems to hate) is more about chasing/jump scares, more tension based same with FNAF but somehow they are worse. No blood or gore. 
Anyways, I’m down for brutal opinions. Do you guys think it’s terrible to let my kids play or watch other kids play these? Should I have a discussion about this with her to try to ease her mind? Or just continue to do my best and keep to my own like I’ve been doing? I guess it’s just rough having mean words hurled at you but wanting to keep the peace. And to be clear I respect her decision as a parent to not allow her son to play these, she knows him better than I do and I will always do everything in my power to respect her choices as a parent.

I probably know the answer because I know the amount of kids that incessantly play Roblox or Minecraft but it’s really interesting to see the varied behavior in my children. I have one who plays a bunch of different games, switches games during his 30 minute playtime but I have another who is 100% one game that shifts based on release maybe and it becomes the subject of his offline pretend play. 

First it was rocket league, then splatoon 2, and now fall guys. It’s all he plays, the others become dead to him and he uses cars or stuffed animals when not playing to recreate the games. It’s interesting to see but also a big worrisome. Any thoughts?",N/A,N/A

They're capable of focusing on one game pretty seriously if they want to....they've racked up a crazy number of hours in Minecraft, Human Fall Flat, and a couple others, but in general, if I let them play for a couple hours they're jumping from game to game pretty often.

My wife and I have 3 wonderful boys. The oldest is 16, he is funny, intelligent, he is a leader in his school. He is everything that I *thought* I was in HS, except he actually is cool. Our middle is 12, and he is a sweetheart. He is sensitive, compassionate, helpful, and kind hearted. Our youngest... He makes life interesting. Let's call him Steve. Steve is 9 and in 4th grade. He has Autism and ADHD. That's nothing unique for us. Everyone in the household in Neurodivergent on some level. Steve has always been the one who gets into mischief over it. But lately he has been taking it too far. He has been flipping people the bird. He has calls his teacher racists just for laughs (they're both the same racist and nothing was happening, he was just thought I'd be a funny joke). And this week, he grabbed a female classmate around when waist and pulled her into him. 

We have no idea where he learns this stuff. We don't have cable, all he does when he is watching TV is watching Roblox YouTubers and he does it in the living room so we know what he is listening to. Maybe he is learning it from kids at school but HE is the one who can't control himself and gets in trouble for it.

He gets a lot of leeway because of his AuDHD. But this time he did get suspended because another kid was involved and her parents are pissed (completely understandable). He will be going back on Monday.

We have always been concerned about ABA because a lot of  Autism sources pain it as brainwashing, but we're out of ideas.

My wife works for the school district and is mortified. She wants to homeschool, but that's impractical. Plus, even if it was practical, it doesn't solve the problem of him needed to learn that this isn't OK behavior.

One of the issues with ADHD is that you don't learn from your mistakes. I have ADHD so I know first hand how seriously this can effect your life and behavior.

1. There are many therapeutic options out there other than ABA. If your child isn't in cognitive behavioral therapy or receiving wrap around services, he should be.
2. People with ASD are concerned about ABA for many reasons. It's not really about brainwashing, but there's concern that it teaches kids to mask or 'act neurotypical' in a way that is not healthy. Historically, ABA used abusive practices. Again, there are many therapeutic options out there. ABA is not the only option.
3. Your child is 9yo. You really don't have a lot of control over what he's being exposed to outside of your home. You should simply assume he is being exposed and have a big talk with him about it. You should also come up with a strategy for this kind of issue in the future, because he's only going to be exposed to more problematic language and behavior in the future. 
4. Also, you're incorrect about people with ADHD not learning from their mistakes. They absolutely do. But impulsive behavior and lack of emotional regulation can cause people with ADHD to repeat mistakes. Also, children in general tend to repeat mistakes because they are children.
5. Does your son have a 504 or IEP? Because if he doesn't, he absolutely needs one. Also, he may need adult supervision when it comes to interacting with other children. If the school has a social skills group, he should be in it.

My son has ASD and ADHD. He's 11yo and in 5th grade. Currently, he gets cognitive behavioral therapy once every two weeks (with the option of more if he needs it), and we are currently looking at social skills groups and occupational therapy. At school, he has a 504 and we have the special education department, therapists and teachers all on the same page. He has a support network in place and as soon as any problem arises, we can nip it in the bud and have strategies in place.

Essentially, it doesn't sound your son is receiving the therapy or structure he needs to flourish at school. You both need to go to the school and start talking to therapists to get him set up in a program that will help him succeed.",it4id0s,N/A

I don't suggest that.

Instead I suggest you keep a line of dialog about his/her gaming sessions open.  Be inquisitive, ask questions.

Over the holidays we've done lots of walks, parks, activities etc and been lax regarding the digital babysitters. The kids (9m and 7f) get themselves up and can help themselves to cereal/make toast until Mum gets up or I get in from nightshift. Boychild has taken to getting up really early (6am ish) and going down to play on FIFA on the PlayStation. 

After repeatedly being told that TV is ok, but gaming isn't we concluded the trust based system wasn't working and activated screen time limits and active hours restrictions on the PlayStation. 

The next morning he was still up early and playing Roblox on the PC. Delivered lecture about the fact that the PlayStation was locked should have meant that the PC was out of bounds too and restricted screen time and active hours on the PC too. 

Just realised that he's been playing FIFA for longer than his daily screen time limit, and questioned him. It turned out the little sod had used his allotted time and then logged into his sister's profile to carry on playing.

Why is tv okay but not games? Games are interactive, the child is learning something because it requires instructions and hand eye coordination. TV is passive entertainment.

In any case, you need to add PIN codes to your consoles. We have a pin code on our PS5 and XSX. The kids can't even sign on without asking me to put in the pin. There are also passwords that block them from buying or downloading new games. You can also add a pin code or password for startup on a PC. 

It's easier to control their ability to access a game than it is to control the time on a game. When my kids ask to play, I put in the pin code and they have a strict time limit. We start a timer and give warnings multiple times as their time goes down. Egg timers are great, as well.",im0jusf,N/A

Look, I was the absolute worst at my kids' age, so karma has hit me a few times.  But kids thrive when boundaries are firm.  If you give him an inch he will take a mile.  

My kids get one hour of computer time a day and 2 hours TV or 3 hours total screen time if they choose to just watch TV (they never do).  I am of the opinion that computer time affects them negatively and no peer-reviewed article or lecture will change my mind.  I formed that opinion through my own experience with gaming, what I have noticed with their attitudes when they have been gaming excessively, and what I have seen working in preschools and the public school system.  

My kids are on the honor system and they abide by it.  I took their computers away for an entire month last year for repeated ""evasions"" and I don't think they'll be making that mistake again.",im23kz6,N/A

Weird I know but are there gamer moms here? I love gaming and have loved it since I was 5. Both me and my husband play alot of PC games, (Monster hunter, souls games, overwatch etc). We also have a 2 year old. I'm afraid that if my child grows up and sees that I'm into video games it will affect her in a... negative sort of way like she might not be focused on studying etc. since her mom plays games and she'd end up having a video game addiction idk lol. I only play when she's asleep but our house is a geek's heaven with different consoles and PCs, name it we have it.

I just feel like moms should only be baking, cooking, reading books, doing arts and crafts and being all motherly (like my mom) and not gaming or playing drums or building gundam kits or listening to heavy metalmusic. I guess my question is, are there moms here that share similar interests but their kids turned out... y'know, okay? Lol I know it's weird but since being a mom I've been lost, not knowing if I should give up my passions and just have typical mom hobbies.

EDIT: So many great replies, eye opening ones too. Thank you!!! I am relieved. All the stories of families gaming together made me excited to play with my daughter. And I won't lose my passion and what makes me who I am!!!",N/A,N/A

Some moms bake!  My sister is a crunchy mom - she makes the cute bento lunches for her kindergartener, homemade granola bars for her toddler, every dinner is from scratch.  She sews their clothes and does all sorts of neat things like that.  She’s a great mom!

Some moms read and work!  My sister in law is amazingly smart and scholarly.  She teaches university and does research.  Her kindergartener speaks 2+ languages and goes to conferences with her.  She’s a great mom!

Some moms craft and run and game and work full time.  My kindergartener does road races with us and helps pick out colors of yarn.  We play age appropriate games together (Pokémon, skylanders) and they learn how to be strategic and a good winner/loser.  I’m a good mom!

Moms come in all shapes and sizes: we don’t fit the cookie cutter mold of the 50s ideal mom - and that’s okay!  Your kid won’t like everything you like - and that’s okay!  They won’t be traumatized because you have your own interests.  If anything, knowing parents have their own interests and are their own person can help children establish their own personalities, interests, and opinions with less pressure and struggle.

Plenty of moms in my generation (older Millennial) enjoy video gaming, listen to heavy metal music, have tattoos, etc. All the things traditionally frowned on for women. Don't let the patriarchy dictate your interests. The best thing you can do for your kids is to not bend to becoming a stereotypical suburban housewife, if that isn't what you want to be.

We’ve gone through lots of cute indie games! I got a rare, unsolicited “I love you” from my oldest stepson, who said “if it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t be playing Zelda Windwaker and I really like this game!!” Lol I’ll take it!

I have fond memories of sitting in my dad’s lap as he played Myst as a kid, and watching my parents duke it out in Dr Mario and Mario Kart. And even now, I play games remotely with my teenage nephew to stay connected with him as he lives several hours away. I think video games can be so fun and social.

Kid and Husband play Overwatch, Monster Hunter, LoL, Borderlands, etc.  Our video game budget is intense.  

I was always into it too.  When Game Boy first came out I saved up so much Christmas, Birthday and odd job money to buy one.  I also saved up and bought my own Playstation when that came out, my little brother was so mad I took it to college with me.  Now we have like 2 gaming PCs, 2 switches, multiple consoles from various generations, the fastest internet money can buy.  You will often find some combination of us bonding by playing video or tabletop games together.  

I have passions outside of gaming, I ride horses and mountain bike and love hiking and kayaking and the outdoors.  I like making art, I'm not GOOD at it but I do it anyway.  I love going to concerts and music festivals, and we bring out kid to them when it is an appropriate band(s), venue, etc.  

I have no issue at all with role modeling enjoying gaming to my kid.  I do also like to role model having a variety of hobbies, and enjoying physical activity and nature.  But, I like those things.  If I didn't, I might not force myself to role model doing things I don't enjoy beyond that having some physical activity in your life is like eating vegetables just something we need to teach our kids is important to their health.

I have seen no bad outcomes from this.  I have never gotten on the ""screen time will rot your brain"" train and never counted screen time minutes.  I just make sure there's plenty of good stuff and balance.  I'm 100% okay with modeling, that sometimes as an adult woman I am going to do my own thing and often that is gaming. Hell sometimes I'll leave the dishes undone tonight because I got a new game and I'm excited, but I'll catch up tomorrow.  Kid works hard in school - gets good grades, teacher has complimented his work ethic and said he tries hard.  He reads at or above grade level, he's interested in so many different things.  He has great PC skills because he also gets into digital art on his PC, and going into a word processor and writing stories.  If a question strikes him like a science question or something, he googles it.  He's well mannered, kind and polite.  

Funny thing actually, last night my kid was asking me to write down his Roblox account name so he could give it to a friend.  I was like dude, you should make a little business card.  Your name, your Roblox account, Steam account and Nintendo Friend Code.  He did make them, cut them out, and has them ready to give to 3 friends at school.",hrcv23o,N/A

We live a similar life. I don’t game like I used to because I have 2 kids and no energy. But my husband frequently plays in front of the kids. He has bought some games to play with our 4 year old. Our house is similarly geeked out. As long as it’s not just all about gaming and you introduce them to other things so they can find the hobbies they enjoy, and support those hobbies, they’ll be fine.

My husband and 4 year old like to bake and cook together, we all read together, I like to do arts and crafts with them, which they enjoy. We’re trying out different sports. But at the same time My husband also listens to Metallic in the car with them (“patallica”as my son calls them). My 2 year old sings parts of Master of Puppets at daycare.

My son is 13 now in a few weeks. I honestly think it’s a great advantage. The reason is because as gamers we completely understand what is out there in the online gaming community. My son is completely aware of online safety and often times if there is a little one in the group he will take them under his wing and include them. He also really wants a new gaming PC. I am proud of him because he is saving money for one. We have all the systems including the oculus. He has loads of friends at school and all of them game too. Recently he started using discord. This also gives us an advantage as discord users ourselves.
We have a saying in our house, “A family that games together, stays together!”
Whether that’s board games or video games. 😉

The biggest advantage is that my son is wanting to learn coding and how to build apps. In middle school he is doing computer classes for all his electives. I told him if he really wants to learn this start now and don’t wait till college because it will be a easier!

My favorite hobbies are hiking and watercolor painting. I do cook and clean, and I love baking. I do crafts, learning and experiments with my son.

I have friends with kids, they seem to be able to work full time, find all this time to make everything from scratch, do laundry all while keeping their house spotless. While I have in the past felt I was an “inferior” mom, when in reality, I’m doing all very similar things. I reminded myself that my child is health, fed and LOVED, and that’s all I can ask for! Could my house be cleaner if I did game? Maybe, but maybe I wouldn’t do it anyways!  Give yourself some grace, we don’t have to give up our hobbies and sense of self when we become moms, we adapt so we can still do something for ourselves! 

You’re doing a great job :)",hreg5ra,N/A

I play or watch TV while she's awake. It teaches her to learn to play by herself. When I first started being a stay at home mom, I felt the same way as you. I thought I was only allowed to clean and cook. And I started getting so stressed out because that meant I never had time to do anything that I wanted to do. My husband has had to instill into my brain that the house doesn't have to be spotless every day and I don't have to cook every day to be a good mother. He and I were raised very differently. So I'm glad that he believes that. And it's taken some work to get to where we are, but he also helps me around the house when he gets off work like with cooking or cleaning out feeding the toddler or bathing her. 

There is no perfect mom. Only the perfect mom for your kids. You can teach them your values that you want them to learn while still gaming.

I have made a significant effort to learn to do certain things I wished my parents taught me. Things I felt would have made my life a lot easier. 

I didn't have anyone teach me how to cook or how to manage my finances. Two things which I felt would have significantly affected some of my life choices. Either having a better diet / being a better cook and how to avoid unnecessary debt. 

I think that if you don't want your kid to be addicted to gaming then you yourself should be aware of how much time you spend on gaming too. Try to do other things in addition to gaming so that isn't your child's and your family's only hobby.

For instance my husband and I game on a daily basis. However, we still make home cooked meals, go for walks, go to the gym, go to the park, enroll our son in sports, do crafts, color, and have days filled without just being glued to a computer. I do specific things to create an environment that will help my son be well rounded.

I am actually a game developer, though I currently build physical logic games. I have also taught about video games at college level, where one of the subjects has been addiction.

Video game addiction is problematic because the way it is phrased in psychology is how many talk about other hobbies that are not considered problematic. I will suggest looking into articles and such by psychologist Chris Ferguson, who has looked into the subject extensively. When the classification of game addiction came out in 2018, he stated that that should have had him classified as addicted to fishing - but no one did, because fishing is not believed to be problematic. A lot of data also point to game addiction being more a symptom of other problems or even just parents not understanding how games work.

I met my husband through gaming and we played MMORPGs together through our children’s babyhood. We found that once they were toddlers, it became much much harder (almost impossible) to keep up with MMOs due to the time sink nature. As I grew older I switched mostly to what I’d call the “cozy gamer” genre. The animal crossings and stardew valley type games. And now that my kids are older, we all game together!

The 8yo does a lot of Minecraft, and Animal Crossing but enjoys some indie goodies with us like Donut County, Unpacking, Cozy Grove, Pikuniku, Everything). We’re also having BeatSaber VR or Rockbandnights instead of Karaoke or Bowling like other families lol. 

Everyone is so happy!!! There is no actual restriction on “screens”. We have activity time where kids are free to choose the activity they want, it may be drawing, playing with Lego, watching cartoons, making blanket forts… or playing video games. 

It’s not simple to explain that to other parents from my oldest’s school. Some of the kids never touched a game pad in their lives it’s so sad. I think they are missing out lol. 

All of this to conclude that Im a friggin HERO in their eyes. They can count on me and my SO to show them the coolest and best games there is.

My child is 1-years-old, so I can't answer your question directly. Right now my gaming is Animal Crossing after bedtime, but I did purchase Mario Party Superstars hoping that they'll play it with me when they're old enough.

My parents played video games with us, N64, GameCube, and some XBox. I think as long as you have a good balance of different activities, gaming is just another fun thing you can do together as a family.",hrfbk9y,N/A

My wife and I used to paint figures for our D&D games, and would hit GenCon every year. We painted warhammer figures with Junior when he was little, and I played the munchkin ""role-playing"" game he created when he was about 10 (talk about long, tedious \[edit: parental\] labor). He's been gaming since he was able to hold a controller. I used to sit with him in my lap while he ""played"" Need for Speed, which involved accelerating and not steering. He's graduated to bigger, better games, and can now even hold a controller! In fact, he very well may have killed you in a game online.

As for music, my wife listens to weird-ass dubstep music that sounds like my nightmares, and which Junior loves. I am a Deadhead, which Junior mocks. Except for that one fault (lol) he's a thoughtful, educated almost-adult who is interested in the classics, and is looking at very challenging college programs commensurate with his excellent grades.

My babies fell asleep being held while we played games. All 3 of our kids are excellent students, and they grew up playing video games too. They started on ABC Mouse as soon as they took an actual interest in games (like 16-18 months old). All 3 started preK being able to read and write (which their teachers were super surprised about). Their whole lives we have made sure to show that, while gaming is great, real life always comes first. 

We make family priority, and no one is allowed to play games or watch TV without knocking out chores, homework, and 1 hour of “reading time” first. Daddy goes to work when he comes home, he spends time with the kids, helps with homework, helps with dinner, and whatever needs doing before he plays games, and that helps, I think, by setting the biggest example for them. I’m a SAHM so I tend to use my kid free time while they are at school to play games, so when they come home, they see me shutting my games off and spending time with them (I usually do chores after they get on the bus til about lunchtime and then game a few hours before they get home), cooking dinner, and doing whatever else needs doing. 

Honestly there’s nothing wrong with being a gaming family, so long as you make a point to teach the kiddos priorities like homework/education, household chores and going to work is important.",hrhtfwd,N/A

I enjoy video games myself. I generally only play a couple of times a week when the kids and partner have gone to bed. Occationally, if we're all having a chill day, I might play in front of them, ensuring they play too (If they want to. If they don't want to the game is put away.). There are many fun games suitable for adults and kids. Forza Horizon 5 is our current jam.

What I find with games is, I need to make a concerted effort not to get too engrosed in them. Other people in the room should always come first. The pause button is well worn...",hrdggkg,N/A

I’d like to add that my sons father and I divorced years ago, he was more of a gamer who also enjoys Rock and Metal music and can actually play the instruments to match the music.

So… I see it as my 3 year old will be exposed to many different hobbies and most likely will favor some over the others as he grows. Currently he loves being outside playing with dirt and dinosaurs or trucks, plays some games on my PS4 (Rocket League) and loves water and the beach as long as there are no crazy surfer waves.

Do you think children whose moms bake become addicted to baking and don’t study? Do you think children whose moms do arts and crafts become addicted to papier mache and don’t study? Why would it be any different here? 

Why do you think being “motherly” is art and cooking, rather than loving, caring for and engaging with your child? 

Are you judging moms who do non-stereotypical things? If not, then why are you judging yourself? 

And finally, no you don’t have to be a 1950s housewife to be a good mother, but yes, I think you should be trying to do lots of different things with your daughter. Playing computer games, reading, art, sport, visiting new places, cooking. It’s all good.",hrdj80c,N/A

I'm a gamer too, though I have to limit myself because I'm the type of person who can get so wrapped up in games that I struggle to sleep, eat, go to work... I actually avoid the games I would find most exciting because I worry I wouldn't be able to control myself. In high school I was so obsessed with text-based RPGs (the predecessors to WoW, when graphics and internet connections weren't good enough for that sort of thing) that I only slept about 3 hours a night and started to hallucinate and have other mental health issues. 

But that's all beside the point. There's nothing wrong with women gaming. There's nothing wrong with children seeing women game. In fact, it's great for kids to be exposed early to the idea that games, science, technology, sports, history, theater, baking, anything and everything is ok to both girls and boys. Gaming culture can be really toxic specifically because men who currently game didn't get taught that, and now get their boxers in a twist over sharing the space. Let's end that as quickly as possible and let our girls enjoy gaming (or baking, etc) and our boys enjoy knitting (or baseball, etc) and our enbies enjoy bird watching (or matchbox car racing, etc). Basically give kids plenty of options explore and let them pursue the ones they enjoy. Your child may be more likely to like gaming because they see you doing it, but in that case you have a shared interest with your child which sounds wonderful to me.",hrdjl1p,N/A

I’m sure the same can be done for gaming. 

I think it’s important for kids to see their parents are still people and have hobbies and activities outside of being a parent. It makes for happier more fulfilled parents too. My parents gave up all their hobbies when they had kids, stopped doing date nights, etc. and it really warped my perception of a)relationships and b) what parenting is actually like.

Gaming doesn't seem to be harmful in itself, but it does eat up time that would otherwise be spent doing activities that have very strong positives for development. Reading, playing outside, studying, building, being bored. One theory seeking to explain why girls now outperform boys at almost every academic level all the way up to graduate school is that boys spend considerably more time gaming than girls; girls are still reading books. Folks like my spouse spend hours every day pouring over data to make their game more fun and compelling to players. Spouse and his team members are good at their jobs. So even if they don't set out to make an addictive product, what will be the result of a few years of this effort? The game is really, really, really compelling. An immature brain has frankly no chance of resisting its allure. I did not want to be constantly fighting about time limits, so our rule therefore was no screen amusement for kiddo during the week.

We’re also careful to limit her game time, and if she puts up too much of a fuss when it’s time to shut down the games, she loses access to video games for a few days. Thats really starting to sink in, so we’re getting very little push back these days.

Ours are 8 and 5.

There was no way they'd not see games and tech in this house, but we make sure to avoid playing violent stuff in front of them, and anything really sweary or screamy gets headsets.

Both children play all sorts, but we limit the time and we try to keep them from playing every day.  We play with friends one afternoon every weekend, so they get to play then and that's their biggest gaming session too but I'll usually expect them to have ""earned"" it by us going for a walk, doing some tidying, reading and so on.  Both have plenty of friends and outside interests, tennis, tai-kwon do, after school football for him and ""multisports"" for her, for instance, so that fear I had about them becoming social rejects or addicts, wasn't worth worrying about. 

We're starting to see some benefits to the extra tech exposure with our son, I guess - he is very IT literate and extremely interested in development.

My hubby and I are into gaming, me more console and him more board games/card games (Magic mostly). We also mostly don't play during the day but if I am playing it's something I can more easily put down if my kids need me (like a turn based game on my laptop). They know about DnD and my hubby and I look forward to playing with them when they're older. I also cosplay (though less so during the pandemic 😭) and my older girl in particular wants to make costumes with mommy, I even bought her her own little sewing machine (she's 7).

I think my kids will turn out alright with geeky parents, I just have to keep in mind to model better behaviour in terms of not ignoring them in favour of my games and not playing aaaaallll the time around them. I want them to know that gaming is fun and a good hobby but don't want them to become addicted to gaming if they also decide to take it up.

Joking aside, I've been a huge gamer since I was about 7 (I'm 33 now and been playing WoW pretty hardcore since 2004, I'm also an avid souls gamer, nioh, Sekiro etc and loving nier automata right now) Her hobby isn't cooking, baking, cleaning as I do all that in the house, but instead, she reads and watches films (writes reviews so basically a film critic.)

Never once have I expected her ""mummy"" role to be as chauvinistic as being in the kitchen whilst on maternity and I bring home the bacon. Although we're both on a haitus from our hobbies since our DD 5 weeks ago, we both fully intent to return to having our ""own time"" in the next couple of months. Granted not as much as we used to do.

Basically, it doesn't matter what your hobbies are, as long as your offspring is raised happy, full belly, adequate sleep, and knowing right from wrong. Let your kid embrace the gaming life!

1: no gaming Monday-Thursday.
2: nothing too scary for the littles
3: Must clean up their messes before gaming 
4: after an hour to two hours, it’s time to get up and go outside. (sometimes Mario party takes awhile)
My 17yo and I play Blizzard games (all of them), switch games, ps4 games, hubby plays Xbox and steam games, and the littles mainly play the switch. But sometimes they’ll play on their computers/iPads.

I mainly use it as a reward and also to connect with the kiddos.
Now before I get hated on, we play board games, we play outside (we have quads, motorcycles, and a huge playground on our back yard), we go on vacations that consists of all 6 of us, going dry camping up in the mountains. There’s always a healthy way of incorporating all things you like with your kiddos.
And if I’m honest, the 7 and 6 year olds will only game sporadically. They get board and find something else to do. Also depends on the situation. Example: my kids were on break for the past two weeks. Last Sunday we played Mario party, smash brothers, and Mario kart ALL DAY LONG. Except in the morning we painted. We don’t really do the whole “limit your screen time” thing. Because the kids get bored anyways and walk away.
I loved when my 17yo and I would play World of Warcraft together. We’d play hide and seek and just goof around.

I’d like to also add I sew, I bake, I paint, I keep fish, I garden, and I hate laundry lol… not one of us fits a specific mold. We are all unique and absolutely perfect. (Unless you’re an asshole.. then you suck lol)

I am a gamer (35f) and my spouse is an addicted gamer (40m). There’s a major difference. My kids DO see me play games (they are 4 & 6) but they know I will die in a game to do whatever they need (open a snack, wipe their butts, tend to an upset, etc), as well as do all the things that need to be done (walk the dogs, do the laundry, homeschool them, MY schoolwork, etc). My spouse is the opposite. They ONLY see him gaming every waking moment he is at home and they trust him with nothing because gaming is first. My 4yr old will ask “daddy are you in a safe spot” before he asks for a need. (Spouse thinks it’s cute that he “understands”, I find it disgusting that my 4yr old finds that to be a priority over assisting him). 

That all said, I think as long as there is balance, you are fine. And my kids DO love video games. My 4yr old’s face lit up when I downloaded Roblox to play with him (vs my spouse who goes “can’t wait till you can do my games”… see the difference in priority?). I’m not as into the Nintendo Switch as my SO, so my kids happily play Mario Kart, Mario Party and the like with him.

Do yourself a favor - Don't judge the next generation based on one from years past. Though many things will be similar, there will be numerous important differences. 

Playing age appropriate games together and sharing time also offers you the opportunity to impart life lessons casually so that it never feels like a lecture. My wife has played every Elder Scrolls game, and is playing Skyrim as I type this.

I know for sure that if my baby wants to play wow with me when she'll be of age i'll be more than happy. We'll wait 16 for first tattoo ;) ! 
You can still take time to discover new activities with your children. Baking star wars cookies, there's great geek cooking books ! Good luck",hreqw1b,N/A

Don’t be ashamed of your interests and hobbies. Your kid wants to do whatever you’re doing because of YOU. If you want to teach the kid crafts, do some crafts together. You don’t have to be a Pinterest mom to go buy a birdhouse kit or construction paper and glue and googly eyes at hobby lobby. 
If you want to teach the kid to bake or cook, do it together. If that means refrigerated cookie dough bought at Walmart or scratch made lemon meringue pie, do what works for you. Have fun. 
If you want to teach the kid how to drum or which Finnish metal bands are the best, spend some time with them playing and listening and debating! Take them to a concert. 
Help them find their interests and passions and be open to whatever they want to do, not just what you do or what you or your parents (or society) thinks they should do. Try things together and have fun.",hretdbf,N/A

You're not a bad parent for exposing your kid to video games. Mom needs to unwind and have hobbies as much as dad and the kid. As others have said, this isn't the 50s anymore. Moms come in all shapes and sizes.

I'm 53 and I've been playing since Atari. I raised 4 kids alone as a divorced mom and they all play. I've been playing online and in the stream of a good friend for over a year now. Here's how to make sure your kids adjust to a healthy work/play/life balance:
1. If they get angry, turn it off; it's no longer a game when it affects real life. 
2. Games are for relaxing and you can't truly relax until the work is done and this includes chores. 
3. Use your best judgment about which games your kids are ready to play. The guidelines are great and I'm happy we have them; but, that's all they are is guides. You know your kid. 
4. Goes with #3. Be ready to explain to help your kids understand fantasy and reality and the difference between the two .
5. Respect goes both ways in the online community just like it does irl. 
6. Make sure they see you respecting the balance between life and games. That's going to be the best lesson of all.

I came to video games later in life and my childhood was very outdoorsy and I'd really like the same for my kids.

Having said that, video games have been a bit of a saviour for me. As I'm sure you know, parenting babies can be a crippling emotional mess at times. The thing i dont see people talking about a lot is that its almost impossible to think about other things while you're playing videogames. Turning your brain off or focusing on something that's not parenting is such a gift some days.

I think a trap a lot of parents fall into (myself included) is suddenly viewing their lives through what is good for their kids. But you were  a person in the world before you kid came along and you need to do things for you. As long as youre not endangering your child, its ok for you to have a thing just for you and with your partner. I wish my wife played videogames, it would be a way to do something together that we both enjoy at home and spend fun time together something that's pretty hard in COVID, toddler times.

Currently oldest is graduating with a bachelors degree  in psychology, middle child is getting certificates in welding and working and my youngest just graduated from high school last year and is working towards a business degree. All still game to some extent some more than others. 

What I am saying is be yourself that’s the best thing you can do for your kids. Let them be themselves and encourage them to do so! Heck we are a punk rock family and my son went through a phase where he listened to only country music, we joked that it was his way of rebelling lol!!",hrglhqt,N/A

They love it! When I finally completed the game my 5 year old burst into tears and eventually managed to tease out of him he was sad because we wouldn't be able to watch Mario anymore.

They both also love watching my wife play Stardew Valley and get really into helping direct the action on the farm.

Eldest has 10-15 minutes screen time a couple times a week when he's been well behaved, and he likes to play Mario Kart mostly. 

I even wrote a video game specifically for my kids with the characters in the game being their bedtime teddies - one has to rescue the other. He loves it and chooses it for his screen time frequently.

So long as you set boundaries and explain that games are fun but they absolutely do not come before more important responsibilities, you're fine! We take pains to explain that Mum and Dad don't play video games every day, it's something fun we do every now and again when we have time - not an obsession.

So long as your relationship with your hobbies is healthy, and the hobbies themselves are appropriate (like I wouldnt be playing Doom Eternal or Skyrim around them haha), sharing this with your kids can only be positive.

Both my wife and I are big Power Metal fans so Kamelot and Sonata Arctica are blasting in the car most trips. My son's sing along to Manowar.

I think kids will grow up and normalize whatever their situation is. Make these things a bonding experience for the family - these are your little traditions and routines, and this is what they'll look back fondly on when they're older - not ""man my mom was weird"".",hrgnca5,N/A

It's crazy that this seems to be somewhat of a new concept, and that traditional parenting roles seem to be changing much more quickly in our generation than perhaps they have in 100 years. 

I think you're right that great moms can come in all shapes and sizes and don't have to fit a cookie cutter parenting model. 

OPs post clearly reflects that some have trouble with this concept because it deviates from what parenting was in previous generations. 

 My hope is that this new way of parenting has a positive impact on our children and allows them to be who they want to be as well, and makes being able to freely be different from the average person the norm rather than the exception. 

I can't imagine how much differently I would have turned out if it wasn't pounded into my head that moms do this and dads do this. I like to think I do a good job being an active father, but sometimes I fall into more traditional roles as a husband, which is a sin because my wife works just as much and just as hard as I do. 

We all need to do a lot of recalibrating on the way we think looking through the lens of 2022. Thank you for your insightful comment. 

I'm a 31 year old late-night gamer dad with young children whose partner despises gaming. But I think it's important to feel confident that we can all parent how we feel comfortable and forget trying to conform to anyone else's expectations or old cultural norms.",hrdlf10,hrcvv8k

What you experienced is the impact of patriarchy on women internalizing sexist, patriarchal ideas they were raised with.

The older women who buy into the stereotypes are just women who support the patriarchy. Just like in The Handmaid’s Tale (book or TV show), women can support male dominated societies and participate in their own oppression (in case a really obvious example helps this make sense) People can also be oppressed and not even know it. 

Patriarchy is the system where men have the power and make the rules. It’s not just what is said by men. Men, women, non-binary folks, and everyone else can support or oppose the patriarchy. 

That’s an important point too. Men can oppose the patriarchy. It’s just often they don’t because it goes against their privilege (or raises the standards of others, so it feels like their privilege is diminishing when it is staying the same).

We live in a neighborhood with a handful of kids. They all roam the streets and hang out with each other, hopping houses. My daughter (11) was best friends with one girl we’ll call E for a while until E started hanging out with another girl we’ll call L. The few times my daughter has hung out with L, things have gone missing and it turned out L stole them.  When she tried to resolve it, she didn’t get anywhere so I had to contact L’s mom to ask if she had seen said items. Of course this was all just “a big misunderstanding” and L can do no wrong, all three times. Whatever, I just told my daughter not to go into L’s house with her stuff or bring anything she values out to play- keep it at home. 

Many of the kids say L is sweet to parents’ faces and rude behind their backs which I called almost immediately after meeting her but they’re kids so they’re all growing and learning- I didn’t write her off, just kept an eye/ear out when she was here.

Anyway, E and L have teamed up now as besties and there is consistent drama when they are around. My daughter is not perfect by any means and I call her out when I see something she’s done or said that shouldn’t be but it seems they pick on her more often than not. One of the recent issues was stolen roblox pets 🙄 which taught my daughter a lesson not to share her login with anyone. Now there is a whole Snapchat problem (why any of these kids have Snapchat is beyond me- my daughter is not allowed social media and has had her phone taken away each time she tries to sneak it). 

Apparently E and L logged into my daughters old Snapchat account (same login info) from when she snuck it before and sent rude messages to themselves, then texted my daughter asking why she said that. I know it couldn’t have been my daughter because the messages are time stamped and I had already had her turn in the screens by that time. 

I don’t want to bring it up with the parents again because they clearly let their idea of their kids cloud reality and it’s a dead end, we seem to have very different parenting styles re boundaries, accountability, etc.. but basically my question is how do I tactfully keep my child from playing with them and should I? She is very social and just desperately wants to hang out with friends and be around others but ends up doing so at her detriment out of convenience and wanting to belong. I don’t want it to be awkward with the neighbors but also don’t want to see my sweet girl get shit on by a pair of mean girls.

She's still young enough you can control her friends. It's a hard no on hanging out with these girls. I had neighbor child write a nasty email and send it to a parent and signed my child's name on it. The drama was ridiculous. I blocked all of them from our phones and socials. Good riddance. Rather figure out who the rotten kids and parents are before high school and I have little control anymore. 

Sign her up for some classes in your area. Martial arts, art, cooking etc. Let her work on making friends in a controlled environment. It helps a lot. Block the girls and change the passwords. If the parents ask just say you don't feel they're a right fit as friends and maybe they can try again when they're older. If they keep bugging you block them as well. 

As for your daughter have some talks on what makes a good friend. Friends should support you. Not find ways to get you in trouble. They should be kind and make you smile. You don't have to be friends with everyone. Etc ect. American Girl makes a book called A Smart Girls Guide to Friendships that's very useful.",idlt3ay,N/A

But I think by 11, in general, kids are old enough to decide for themselves which friends to prioritize, and parents telling them they're not allowed to hang out with certain people takes away opportunities to develop their own values in friendships. That's a really valuable skill. As much as I would love to steamroll any and all mean girls out of 9F over here's way, I think that (within limits of course) there's so much to be gained from having her see on her own that some friends make you feel better about yourself than others, and having me being a loving pair of arms to run into when she's hurt instead of someone who pushes all obstacles out of her way. 

Maybe you could sit her down at a time when things are calm and say something like ""Hey, I was thinking, I don't really know Eliza very well. What are some things you like about her?"" or if you want to make it less targeted at her, maybe you could start a discussion at the dinner table about what makes someone a good friend or a bad friend, with everyone offering their views. Just providing opportunities for her to reflect ""is this someone that genuinely makes me feel good about myself?"" but not forcing her or criticizing her friends yourself. 

Another thing you could try is getting her enrolled in some other activities away from these two that can help her make new friends. Drama classes, art camp, community sports teams, whatever. Or if that's not an option you could try gently nudging her towards other friends, for example, asking, ""Hey, I was going to make pizza tonight. Would you like to invite \[peripheral friend\] over for pizza and a movie?"" 

I do think that ultimately this should be her decision, though. You can be a shoulder to lean on, you can give advice if she asks, but I probably wouldn't try to tell her what to do.",idlrr2s,N/A

I know it sucks because they're in the neighborhood. Her login should have been changed the first time there was shenanigans with the Roblox. She doesn't need to be rude to them, but when they come around, she can remove herself from the situation.

Is it fair? No, not really. The mean kids should be the ones that get the consequences. Sadly, that is just not the way it works out in these situations. I wouldn't go to their parents, because like you said, they're not going to admit it. I would be prepared for one or both sets of parents to ask you what happened, and you can say ""They aren't kind to my kid."" And if they want to fight, just say the conversation is over.

Happily, your daughter is getting to the age where she'll make more/other friends at school and neighborhood friends become less precious.",idlov1j,N/A

Family Sharing lets you share the purchases from each member account among all members of the family including iCloud storage, which is a really nice feature, but it also lets you manage ScreenTime and other parental controls including requiring approval for all app installation and in-app purchases. 

Hopefully Apple can get this resolved for you and at the same time help you establish proper parental controls/family setup - they are powerful magic when you’re in the Apple ecosystem (and a significant reason for why it’s a good ecosystem to buy into - getting equivalent privacy, parental control, support, and features is considerably more difficult (and expensive) when using a combo of different platforms like Android, Windows, whatever your TV runs, etc. not impossible, but certainly a lot more complicated to manage.

But - 100% agree with extra chores, showing him the house budget and explaining that you're going to have to remove ""fun"" things for awhile to make up for this money - and even withdrawing him from activities, till say January/February in order to ""save money""

Depending on the kids age/location/abilities - I'd even be having him doing odd jobs for neighbours, family, friends, etc - and having to hand all that money over to you - and even selling his own stuff like say gaming consoles, electronics, etc. But again - depends on the kid and where they are.",hncar1s,hnaattm

Bank of dad required her to produce an analysis of her spending over the last month and to explain why she didn’t have gas money (I already knew since I have access to her bank account, but she needed to go through the motions of understanding where the money went). 

And then we sat down with her and asked her to figure out how much gas she needed every week to make it to work, what that would cost (with a fudge factor for additional driving around town and variability in the price of gas) and to determine how much money she had left to spend on whatever, and letting her know that when the car insurance renews, she’s on the hook for hers going forward. 

And then once she did all that (getting a loan is a lot of paperwork, after all), we then negotiated the terms of the payday loan, and how much the vig was gonna be (she was gonna have to mow the lawn and do some extra chores on top of paying back the principal which is a pretty usurious vig when you think about it). 

But it’s much better for these lessons to be learned (budgeting, not blowing all your money on twitch, what a terrible idea payday loans are, how much money adulting costs, why DoorDash is a stupid idea when you’re just sitting at home craving a $2 box of McFries etc) when the stakes are a $30 tank of gas, rather than when they’re “not being able to make rent or the power bill”, or “Guido is threatening to come break your legs because you didn’t pay the loan”",hncaiad,hnbvfdr

Think about what you’re saying. A company that has hired psychologists  to addict children *in order to make money* … needs to voluntarily recognize that they do this and thus also develop safeguards *in order to prevent children from spending too much money.*

The exact same phenomenon you’re describing applies to literally every single app designed for either children or adults. It describes your whole smartphone. And grown adults should be aware of this, and take appropriate measures to counteract it while the law catches up with technology.

When did you ever hear me *complain* about microtransactions? I literally just stated they they’re out there deliberately to make money. Which is true. Which all parents should be aware of and take precautions against. 

Again, did you read my point? Go back and read everything I wrote. I don’t know who you think you’re responding to, but I don’t think you’re addressing a single thing I actually said. I think you have just assumed that since I disagreed with one thing you said, I must be attacking the developers and defending the parents. 

Go ahead and look at the first comment I made in this thread. Please. You are just repeating everything I have already said, just in an unhinged, accusatory fashion.

Clearly you feel very passionately about this. I totally agree (which would make sense seeing as I said all of this in my own comments, twice, which you clearly didn’t read - though without the unnecessary porn analogies).

Please go and touch some grass. You have been on this app too long this evening. And kindly take a moment to actually read the conversation you’re participating in before wasting what must have been several minutes of your life regurgitating all of this that’s already been said (by me).

Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/ri1a45/for_parents_gifting_phones_or_tablets_this/,For parents gifting phones or tablets this holiday season. Understand parental controls.,brokeapplefan,2021-12-16,1639691751.0,365,"For parents gifting phones or tablets this holiday season. Understand parental controls.
I lost $16k USD in approximately 8 days, because my child played Monster Legends on an Apple iPad. 

I am posting a copy of recommendations that I have come up with to help you avoid my fate.

Long story short, exposure to technology is great for kids, but for those of you buying or gifting iOS or Android devices to minors this holiday season, here are some words of advice:

If you use Family Sharing with Apple, you will be forced to put payment information on the primary device. So either do not use Family Sharing with minors, or follow some of the advice below.

Also, with family sharing, and the delays that often exist between a purchase and Apple sending receipts to you, or charges to your payment method, if you have valid purchases on one device, and unauthorized purchases on another, they will often get bundled together on receipts and charges. This makes disputing the charges more difficult, because the bank cannot see the number of purchases that make up a single charge.

* Make sure that all parental controls are enabled. If you make a mistake, and your child purchases game content on the tablet, both Apple and PayPal will likely consider that authorized activity.

* Apple makes the process of approving purchases difficult, once those controls are on, and you may have to disable them to purchase anything for your child. DO NOT FORGET TO RE-ENABLE THE CONTROLS. 

* If you upgrade a device that had controls enabled, do not assume that they will be enabled if you are restoring the device from backup.

* There are forms on Apple’s site to report unauthorized purchases by a minor; but, most in-app purchases will not be considered refundable. And, Apple will provide you no information on why a refund was approved or disallowed. You can appeal a denial, but you will likely just get another denial a day or two later, with no detail.

* Set up a small dollar credit card to direct all purchases to. If there are unauthorized purchases, you do not want to use a high limit credit card, or worse, a bank account through PayPal. 

* Apple and PayPal provide no abnormal activity warnings. You will get receipts from Apple and PayPal, but again, it is unlikely that you will get a refund. 

* Based on similar stories I have seen online, Apple puts the responsibility on you to stop the purchases before they get excessive; so do not filter Apple or PayPal receipts in your email. Make sure you get active alerts for any purchases or receipts.

* It is also likely that if you are using a bank account with PayPal, your bank will not provide any abnormal activity protection either.

* Worse, if you use a PayPal account and have multiple funding sources, PayPal will automatically fall over to the second source, if you are using a credit card which does detect abnormal activity, and your primary source rejects the payment. So, they will continue to drain your accounts dry.

My recommendation is to avoid using PayPal for device purchases at all costs. It provides no protection for you, other than hiding your credit card number, and like Apple, they provide no detail if they reject your claim. At least in my case, it does not matter how quickly you identify the purchases. Once they are made, you have no recourse.

Unfortunately, it seems that purchases through PayPal that fall back to a bank account also lose protection that you may have with a credit card, so again, the bank will likely deny your claim.

I assume Google Play is similar, but I have not used it.

Remember, as far as Apple, PayPal and the Monster Legends developers are concerned: any activity that occurs on a device you own is authorized. Side note: Roblox developers do support refunds, which is much appreciated.

Don’t run into a ruined holiday season and upcoming child’s birthday like my family is now going to have because of a simple mistake in configuring your device.

AMA about how to protect your account, and based on my experience I will try to provide guidance.

I just checked my daughter’s iPhone. Had to look it up to figure out where the setting even is.

In case anyone else needs it, here’s how to make sure your kids can’t make any in-app purchases on an iOS device. 

On the device, go to Settings > Screen Time > Content and Privacy Restrictions > iTunes and App Store Purchases 

There you will see the option to disable in-app purchases.

But the attitude that you, and fortunately, only a few others have shown here with some judgement about me not paying attention to my child when you have no fucking background on anything other than what I shares—in an attempt to help educate others—is fucking infuriating.

I don’t have the luxury of spending all of my time with him 24/7. Does that mean that he sometimes spends time on a computer, a tablet, or watching TV, yes. But I never said that I was using a tablet to substitute for parenting. I am fortunate enough to live in an area where the school includes technology in grade school and beyond. He has to use a computer and a tablet for school work. I am not going to apologize to you or anyone else for that.

And, as I have learned, something like this can happen in such a short timeframe that you don’t notice it until you see charges somewhere; and as I am trying to alert others, should that happen, it is already too late.

I didn’t post this asking for sympathy or parenting advice. I posted this as a warning to others of what can go wrong, especially as technology gets more complex, and some recommendations to others of things to watch out for, because we can all make mistakes and those mistakes can snowball into something really unfortunate.

I hate Roblox. I’m upset that the 2 only cousins my kids have (out of state), got them into the stupid game and now my oldest won’t stop wanting to play it. I removed it one time but that’s all he wanted to play and I felt like maybe I should balance it out with him doing his school work vs play. My 6 yr old plays it sometimes and now they are getting my 4 yr old into it.

I don’t want my kids to visit their cousins because their parents allow them to play Roblox all day morning and night. They whine to me why can’t they play like their cousins. 

My 6 yr old went thru the games while I watched and it is just ridiculous the games they have on there. My oldest asks why I don’t let him chat etc. Apparently some of his school friends play but I doubt most of them do. 

Now I feel like the strict mom not allowing my kids to do these things and play them. So I never let them see their cousins anymore???

If my husband raised the kids he would just let them play those games. I sometimes wonder if I’m being overly strict and shouldn’t make it a big deal?? 

 Please advice if anyone dealt with these games! Tell me if I’m overreacticing etc 

Thanks in advice",N/A,N/A

One is screen time and addiction. Games just like TV and books are designed to get your attention with an interesting story. And like puzzles, jigsaws and board games they're designed to make you want to keep trying to win the challenge. On top of that they have replayability and are never exactly the same each time you play it.  Young kids cannot be expected to self-regulate against this, you must set boundaries. No matter how much they beg and whine. Explain to your kids why the boundaries are important to you, but don't give in.

The other element is the online social network built into some games. Just like Facebook, your kids are messaging and talking with other people through the game. Do you know exactly who they are talking to? Just because the other person's profile says they are 10 doesn't mean it's true. 

I do let my kids play Minecraft but only on my own server that can only be accessed inside my house. So they get to do all kinds of fun things within our family world, building, sharing and problem solving. And yes after an hour they are very unhappy to be torn away. But I know what it's like and I know the feeling passes. To be honest I'd still prefer they spent their screen time playing games instead of watching the nth repeat of some animated cartoon.

I haven't used Roblox but it does look like they have some offline features - you could look into that.",f77gwze,N/A

13 year old son. Doesn’t play any sports. Rarely leaves the house. Completely miserable when he’s not sitting at his laptop wasting away on Roblox(legitimately his attitude completely changes). If I let him, would sit on his phone all day every day. 

Kid hates me because I have to take his phone or laptop away on a regular basis, otherwise he would spend every single waking hour on the screen. This is not an exaggeration.

He lies to me about it and is constantly sneaking around. Sometimes up until 2am or later on Discord on a school night. 

We go to dinner, he refuses to eat because I’ll ask him to put away the phone and two minutes later he’s got it in his lap typing away. 

I don’t know what to do any more. The kid legit hates me for trying to guide him away from wasting his life behind a screen.

If he had even a single thing in his life that brought him joy. A single hobby or sport, I’d leave him alone. But he doesn’t. 

Do I just stop trying to guide him? Let him waste away? Trying to “break” his habit has done nothing but make him hate me.",N/A,N/A

He needs medical help to address what is underlying and fueling his addiction.

He needs to be cut off, I would certainly seek help in the first instance as when you do cut him off all hell will break loose.

Instead of pushing what you think he should do, but see who he is and what would be good for him. FYI certain games do have an online community. I rped for years and now write stories and talk to other writers, that's my happy place.

I’ve been a long time gamer. Started at 10 yr old. I’ve had phases where I drop gaming for years at a time but I always seem to end up back at a computer. I have the ability to literally sit for 6 -10 hours straight even at 34. It’s not a healthy habit it is 100% an addiction to escape. Not even about the games anymore. I just want to be left alone. 

Now that I am a father of 2 beautiful boys I find myself waiting until the boys and wife are asleep so I can sneak away. This has destroyed my sleep schedule and no matter how exhausted I am I still stay up until 2-3am every night just trying to get my alone time. I hope this shows how gaming can be a real issue. The stimulation from gaming is almost the same as drug use. The times i took a break from gaming before kids I found myself partying hard and fulfilling my addiction for escape in many other ways, drugs, shows, relationships. 

The reason I bring all this up is because it’s concerning. I’m a good man, I take great care of my family, house etc but I still have the itch and am constantly depressed. I think even if he hates you taking away all electronics is a great approach. He may go through withdrawals etc but at least maybe that break may show him what other avenues he can explore with your guidance. Always remember the amount of time you put into an addiction is about half the time it will take to break it.

We just started non electronic time and no screens at dinner. All electronics are charged in living room including kids phones. None in their rooms. If he is sneaky charge in your room. It will be very hard at first. But be consistent and firm. We started small 1 hour increments and have been able to increase the time. Also we turn off all electronics an hour and half before bed. They shower and read or do whatever. Also be available for hanging out or board games during that time. Eventually it will get better but you will probably have a battle for a few weeks. Also if he goes around bugging people then he doesn’t get his stuff back. He’s old enough to talk to and say what the expectations are in the family and those electronics are privileges not rights. It sucked when we got serious but it’s good now. Still have to make sure they get off but it’s worth it. Also I sometimes watch my kids play and talk to them about their game or cheer them on and it has let us bond better by showing interest in their interests then it’s easier when they have to get off to want to be around me.

Our kids have learned to preserve data or be without it for 3/4 of the month when they use it all in one go). It may not stop them from sneaking around and playing something off-line, but we did have control of internet access. 

It's so much harder to regulate things when homework/school requires a device and internet access. The pandemic shot out screen limits all to hell, with virtual school and each kid being assigned a chrome book from school. 

I think you're right to be concerned. This sounds like addiction. My oldest is the most screen oriented, but he started coding around 11/12, and wants to develop video games. He also has other interests. The pandemic resulted in the crushing ability to pursue those, and virtual school and ADD don't mix well. So, the year of virtual schooling he nearly dropped out of high school, stayed up all night on  social media (which I'd been strict on before, but Discord became the only way to really stay in contact with his friends), and it was a mess. He was at least working during that time, which at least got him out of the house and learning some practical skills.

Thankfully, he found a path at an alternative high school for his senior year, and allowing him to explore options and make his own decision (like considering the GED, which he could have passed, but would have lost out on free two years of community college, which he would get by finishing high school in one of our city schools). But, he had a goal he really wanted, which was video game design, to fall back on to help get out of it once we returned to in person school/activities. I have loosened the screen restrictions quite a lot as my kids have gotten older, but keep my eye on other factors, like time spent on other activities, family interactions, how they treat other people in general, whether they are taking care of their own needs for food, sleep, grooming, etc. And that's where the red flags come into play.

Your kid isn't interested in family life, interacting with friends in person, or anything else. Even with his gaming/online hobby, he's not pushing himself to be better at it or learn more skills. This has all the ear marks of an addiction. I would get professional help and take some more drastic measures to detox from tech (maybe best to do in the summer when there isn't school, and after input from a therapist?).",i1j9jbf,N/A

Some reddit parents will say that this is normal and your son is just an introvert, but most doctors would disagree.

Get him into some organized activities so that he can be physically active, even if he goes kicking and screaming. Surely, there must be something outdoors that he likes. Screens are easier, but that doesn't mean there's no joy to be had in other things.

Physical activity is absolutely necessary to health and brain development. Not exercise every day for a decent amount of time at this age will set your son up for huge problems not only now, but down the road. The damage done now can't be undone as it affects how his body develops.

I hope he finds something that sparks his passion. maybe it would be helpful to make a list of different hobbies and possible career fields for the future and sit down with him and ask him to circle what seems most interesting. he will probably act annoyed with you, but maybe looking at a physical list of all the hobbies and also career fields the world has to coffee will make him realize the world really is so much more than the game. it is a shame that the modern world takes advantage of how hyper fixated people can be, especially kids that age. good luck to you and you are a good parent for not just accepting this as normal. I believe he will find his thing :))",ij56d7v,N/A

My 12 year old son is a good kid. He sometimes struggles to complete his chores or lies about small things, but nothing beyond what I believe is normal tween behavior.

Yesterday, I got a birthday gift from MIL of a $100 visa gift card. I decided to get some clothes, I’m 6 months PP so in between sizes. I spend like 94 on Amazon yesterday. Today, my son was cleaning up the kitchen surfaces and the gift card was there. He asked me about it, and I told him to keep it, it has $5ish on it, and mentioned he could use it for snacks at the nearby store(he just recently earned the privilege to go there on his bike or walk, it’s .5 miles and he has a phone.)

Well, he decided instead, without saying anything, that he wanted “Robux” or whatever on his Xbox. He charged for 5, then 10, then 20, then 10 again… and then more small charges for a total of $90!!

Because I ordered from Amazon, it confirmed but probably will not ship. Because it’s a visa gift card I can’t dispute the charges.

Besides grounding him from his Xbox, what can I do? He admitted, after trying to lie, that he kept charging because it was going through. He said he “didn’t think that it was a big deal because I said I already ordered stuff.” 

So now I’m not getting the clothes, which were practically a need at this point because I have no clothes that fit. I haven’t reacted much, but I’m deeply upset.

Edit: I’m just venting and trying to brainstorm. In hindsight I can see where I could have done differently, I’m not saying it’s all on my son. He’s 12 but normally really responsible with money. We  normally give him Xbox gift cards and Roblox gift cards, and his chat, purchases, and downloads are supervised(but apparently the purchase notifications are delayed by like 20 minutes.) 

I’m just saying that he knows better than to keep pressing the purchase amount, and for different amounts, because his best friend bought 400 worth of Fortnite bucks last year and got in trouble. He knows that it’s not ok. He admitted he didn’t think that it was ok, he said he just thought the card had more left than I thought. Even still, he has planned to buy specific snacks at the convenience store, and told me so just minutes before he started buying robux so it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. He admitted he knew he shouldn’t have done it. That’s why I’m trying to figure out an appropriate punishment.",N/A,N/A

I think the trick here is to angle away from punishment and towards 'teachable moment'.

Find a way for him to work it off. He used $85 more than you said he could, so now he can learn to equate work and money. Let him pick some additional chores with a clear repayment value until he's ""earned"" the extra 85.

Then both of you can chalk the whole thing up to a learning experience.

Personally, I don't think that bit is punishable. (I'm not sure what the expected behaviour would be in this case — i.e. as an adult, if that happened to you, what would you do?)

Buying stuff that he's not allowed, that part maybe. But then you were saying that he often gets gift cards for his birthday so it doesn't sound as clear cut as ""you're not allowed make purchases on Xbox"".

For future — You mentioned that purchase notifications are delayed, which makes it harder to monitor. I think you can set it up though to require a PIN for every purchase (Don't have an Xbox, but that's how parental controls on these platforms often work).

He’s not got enough life experience yet to realize that the card shouldn’t have worked that way - if anything I bet he thought he was getting one over on Visa.  When I was a kid (in the dark ages). There was a pay phone in my grandparents town that if you hit the right sequence of buttons refunded the last call.  I saw this magic quarter dispenser as exactly that, never thinking that someone might have trouble for me taking the money (now I think about the employee responsible for collecting the money and the risk that they could have been fired or accused of theft for the amount coming up short).

I'm confused cause I don't order from amazon much - but what happens in that case? Do they ring the truck driver and go ""Nope, don't deliver this?"" or make you return it all? I have no clue haha.

I think you definetly need to sit down with your son and set new rules going forward regarding money. Even if he didn't ""know better"" - he'd still be punished if this was an actual crime right? (I know, bad analogy - sorry). Maybe tell him because this is his first ""crime"" and he didn't actually realise he was doing anything wrong - his punishment won't be as heavy - but now that you may have to go without clothes that you actually need, he does need to understand how mistakes can cause big consequences for people. Ask him how he thinks he could make it up to you? Extra chores, helping out neighbours, selling things he no longer uses, having to cancel a few (paid) fun experiences he had planned, etc. 

I understand that this is a learning experience for both of you - but what if this error wasn't clothes, but money that was meant for food and now you have to go without? Or a medical appointment?

Have a real conversation with him about money and temptation. There are grown adults who cannot be trusted with money in the face of something they want. Talk to him about that impulse and how important it is for him to learn to resist that impulse. Teach him and see the best in him. We all do things we *know* we shouldn't because we're human. Like any human, he did something in spite of *knowing* he shouldn't because it was just a bit too irresistible (not to mention that the game is likely designed to make it as tempting and easy as possible).

So he gets $5 of Robux, and then he gets curious if he can get more. And wow, it just keeps working! In his mind, he’s cheating the “system”, not you. To him, it’s like exploiting a bug in a video game.

Hi parents.

For those of you who may not be familiar with Roblox, it's a website/application that is kindof like an MMORPG for kids.  There's hundreds of different games, from Survivor tv show clones to Fashion Shows to zombie games.    Its free to play, but there is paid content as well.  The site is specifically targeted to kids and teens.  There's a chat feature that can be disabled, and it is somewhat heavily auto-moderated.

I want to take a moment and share my experiences with it, along with a question or two, and to invite you to do the same.

My 8 year old and 5 year old have been playing games on the platform for a while, and both seem to love it.  Recently the 8 year old has gotten interested in the social aspect: friends and chat.

As I said, the chat feature can be disabled, and I explained to her that if we run into problems with chat, that we'd turn it off.  We've worked hard to set expectations so that everyone is clear on the front end.  The friend aspect is rather like the Steam game platform, and you can request that people become your friend.  It doesn't seem to have much impact other than that you can see if they are in a game, and join a game that they are in, as well as messaging.

The computer monitor faces our family living room, so its easy to see at a glance what's going on. I don't tend to hover constantly, but when she's reading or typing in the chat window I make a point to give it a fairly frequent look.  It is as much an exercise in guarding against nefariousness as it is in trying to help and guide her in understanding online interactions.  We have of course talked about safety and predators online, but tbh I'm more worried about hard or soft bullying online, which we also talk about.

One of the things that I'm really working with her on is this friends thing.  There's one person that she's befriended that has a ""cute"" sounding name, along the lines of unicornsparkle.  The 8 year old is delighted when this other person is in the same game with her, and talks (to me) about this person.  I get the feeling that she's drawn to this person largely by their name and avatar/outfit, and less by any quantitative qualities.  I don't mind that, but I'm working to help her get an understanding of what it means to be friends with someone in an online setting.

She has expressed an interest in learning to touch type, so we've found a couple of resources for that.  I think this may help her (now and later), as her typing is pretty slow and basic, and I've noticed a couple of times that her chat responses come so delayed as to lose all context, and once or twice have been misunderstood or misconstrued.

Here's some of the rules and expectations that we have setup for her:  
* Do not give out your name.  We let her come up with a 'nickname', so that she can offer her name if asked, without giving out her personal information.  
* Don't give out other personal info, location etc.  Someone asked her age the other day, and she was quick to not give her actual age, but after thinking about it a moment, age doesn't seem like 'bad' information.  
* No secrets.  
* She won't be in trouble for anything that anyone posts, or that she sees.  If she has questions about anything that she saw or read, she can ask and we'll talk about them, no judging.  
* We expect her to be kind, just as she would to someone in RL.  No namecalling, making fun, bullying, etc.  
* If someone says things that are unkind to her or other people, she should avoid them and can let us know.  Standing up against bullying is also encouraged.  
* She uses the computer with our permission, and asks if she's not sure of something.  

We have the philosophy that there are dangers on the internet, but we don't want to fall into the trap of believing that a child abductor is hiding behind every bush.  She's up to speed on safety in that regard, and it is relatively easy to protect her from this threat.  She is far more likely to run into an unkind person or bully, and it is more difficult to protect her from that.  I feel that by teaching her about these things early that I can help arm her with the information that she needs to be safe and healthy, and have respect for herself and others in an online setting.

Other parents, what have been your experiences with Roblox, positive, negative or otherwise?

If your children are into Roblox, at what age did they become interested in the social aspect of it, and what did/do you allow?

Thanks!

He originally saw some Youtuber play it and was interested. I've spent a lot of time watching what he plays and monitoring the chats, and we've had the same conversations about personal information etc. He does use the chat because he really likes RPGs where you are an animal or a dragon, and a lot of that goes on over chat. But he not allowed to request friends or accept any requests, and a couple times a week I check to make sure no one is trying to message him or anything. He plays different games all the time and so rarely seems to come across the same players twice. 

 As far as I can tell Roblox is pretty well monitored, swear words are banned and won't show up even if typed, and you can report anyone who is breaking the rules.

We take the approach of if you don't know them IRL, you don't friend them.  While there is a social aspect to the game, her school friends play, and that's as much interaction as they need.  Plus, all the kids asking for a mommy/daddy/boyfriend/girlfriend in MeepCity is just creepy.  We don't know if those people are actually kids or not.  (See other thread)


This you should look at:  
How many ""friends"" do they have?  
How many do they interact with?  Setting a limit maybe a reasonable option.  
FYI - What is included in the chats does not indicate what chats happen in the game.  
Teaching good Internet purchases, never giving out any personal information (Real name, city you live in, information about family, etc.)

With regards to media literacy, I encourage my son to ask a lot of questions when things don't make sense. This means not being afraid to say ""I don't understand."" I also ask him to explain what he's watching or playing to me, so I can gauge how he interprets the media he consumes, and help him better understand things he may overlook. 

We also talk about how people sometimes make things up (esp. on social media, YouTube) because getting more attention means they get more followers/views/money.

I honestly think one of the most important things is to help your child build and maintain a life outside of the internet, specifically one that keeps him interacting with kids his age outside of school.

I have a 12 year old daughter who is asking to be able to stay up later to be on her tablet. Currently the tablet is taken away at 7:45 so that we can have family time until bedtime. She goes to bed around 8:45 and is allowed her tablet for music. All other apps are on downtime. I’ve told her she can stay up late to read or draw but she wants to be able to play roblox and talk to her friends. None of them have bedtimes and several of them stay up very late. I know both of these statements are true not just her convincing me. 
We have always been a pretty strict bedtime family and until now they haven’t tried to fight it.  (To be fair, I’m flexible on just about everything else) I believe that sleep is very important to overall health and behavior. But she’s getting older now, and I’m not sure how much wriggle room to give her. How do you manage your preteen’s sleep?

Apologies if this violates the guardian rule, I’m 15 and looking for advice on how to deal with my brother’s screen addiction(on behalf of my parents who don’t use Reddit). 

My father is out working six days a week and my mother is easily fatigued and really can’t handle a rowdy seven year old for very long, so my brother is often given an iPad or other device to keep him quiet and entertained. This has become a full blown screen addiction. 

He watches YouTube or play Roblox and Minecraft on FaceTime with his friend for hours on end and often cries and yells when forced to put down the device. I’ve also noticed that he often emulates the behaviour of the YouTubers he watches in that he’s speaking more aggressively while playing games or just generally yelling more because it’s what’s being portrayed as funny in his videos. 

There have been attempts to get him into some non screen hobbies(reading, legos, etc) but he needs a lot of attention and interaction to stay interested. What are some things we can do to help this?",N/A,N/A

What your parent can do:

- Implement guided access on YouTube on the iPad, you can limit the amount of time within a certain app. My kids get 1 hr a day in YouTube. To get more they need a passcode.

- They can’t download anything so the other apps are educational. They have full use of these apps at all times.

- They whine/cry/throw a fit about the iPad getting taken away? Or the time limit? Guess who just loss iPad privileges for the rest of the day/week and stick to it 

- Show him how to play independently. He will need a lot of attention at first but gradually decrease the time spent with him until he can play independently.

- Look into sports that he can join

- Look at clubs/activities he can take part in 

- Communicate with him the consequences for his actions. Poor behavior mimicking videos he has seen? iPad gets taken away. State what he did and what is going to happen AND stick to it

He is acting the way he is acting because he is getting away with it. 

As parents it is hard, you are always tired, but you still have to show and model the behavior you want them to take.",i4umb17,N/A

Just about every case of full blown screen addiction I've seen begins and ends with YouTube.  It's algorithms are designed to keep people watching and it just destroys kids ability to turn it off.

I have never witness her try to rush for any reason. It’s like she can’t move faster at all. Even natural consequences don’t seem to help because letting her fail will just lead to apathy but she is constantly late. 


It seems so much more than just being late though because she needs to be constantly told/reminded/asked to do homework or get dressed or brush her teeth. She loathes me me telling her what to do but it’s like she is not capable of prioritizing or thinking about what needs doing outside of Roblox (which she only gets to play on weekends after sport).

I've been playing roblox since 2011, and I can tell you that the only thing that makes it inappropriate are maybe the weapons and fighting in some of the games. When characters die it usually isn't bloody but instead it's just a silly death animation with a silly sound at the end.

There ARE inappropriate things on roblox that get passed the moderators, but for your kid to find them, he would have to actively search for them. The thing about roblox is that it's not a game, it's a platform for games to be hosted on like steam. The **players** are the ones who make the games, so there are plenty of inappropriate games, BUT most of these games have hardly any players or none at all, and your kid would have to actively try to find them if he wanted to play them. There is also a chat, which I believe can be disabled, but there really isn't any need to. I have probably spent 2000+ hours playing Roblox over the years and I have never once seen anyone trying to take advantage of a child on the site. The filter is incredibly strict for those under 13 so numbers are almost always filtered out, and most swear words are too. However no filter is perfect, and users can still bypass it by saying things like ""axzshole"". So if you're childs like 5 and you don't want him to exposed to those words then you can disable chat.


I'd say that anyone at any age could play, but depending on how often your kid is exposed to swear words, he may or may not need a filter. I'd say kids should be able to chat no older then the age of 9, because by that time they already know most swear words that people use on the site.


Here's what I would recommend you do to make sure your child is safe on Roblox.

1. Tell him that it's not okay to search for or play games that he knows are inappropriate, if you want you could even make him ask you for permission to play a new game, although given how many games there are on the site, this could get annoying really fast.

2. Check his search history and also a list of the games that he has played recently. This way you will know if he has found anything inappropriate.

3. If you allow him to chat, give him the usual spiel about not giving your personal information on the internet. 



Lastly, you should know that most of the articles you see in the news in roblox are completely false and exaggerated. Roblox is starting to become a popular kids game, and these news sites are purposefully spewing out articles completely riddled with lies, designed to scare you so that they can have better ratings and draw your attention better. These sites are counting on you not knowing anything about the site. I strongly recommend you play with your kid, you'll see it really isn't so bad. In fact it's actually a lot of fun. There are plenty of games for kids but also many for adults or for all ages. So I could see the site as being something you are able to bond over.


Lastly, because I have been playing so long I have thousands of robux(the in game currency). Most games on roblox aren't pay2win, but many of the clothes in the catalog cost robux. If you want, you can send my reddit account a pm with your son's username and I am willing to give him enough robux to buy some nice clothing. ",e31y7go,N/A

2) Granny. It's a Slenderman-themed first-person horror survival game.

Things she loves so far are Roblox games like Survive the Killer, an online game called the The Baby in Yellow (this one was great to play together), and a show on Netflix that is creepy stories for kids (a modern day Goosebumps I suppose!). 

She hasn’t liked Doctor Who in the past but might try showing her the episode Blink with the Weeping Angels.

I could be overreacting but I just witnessed a moment where my 5 y.o. daughter had trouble fitting in.
We were at a graduation party and there were kids. Between 4 to probably 12 years old.

My daughter tried to play along with them with their games like tag, hide and seek, etc and she kept getting ignored. Then a movie was playing and my daughter would point out things in the movie, she got ignored. She tried to show off her Roblox character and still was ignored. She would come to me, crying, saying that no one wants to play with her except the 4 year old who finally got around to play with her.

It was actually heartbreaking because alot of these kids she used to play with growing up and now they seemed to be uninterested in her, even her own cousins. My daughter is very sociable and I felt guilty that she had to go through that experience, experiencing rejection or being ignored.

But I'm wondering what can I do to help her before she starts Kindergarten and not go through the trouble again? She never had this issue during preschool and fit right in with the kids there but this time she had much more trouble being able to join in this group to play.

I even had the feeling that that group of kids were not even a good group to begin with. One was always picking fights, others had made comments about me and my daughter, they even treated a 2 year old like a toy and nearly hurt the 2 year old.

It was literally a party were the kids were left alone and me ending up having to supervise them because no one was watching them while the adults sat and drank all night. I wasn't feeling comfortable leaving my daughter alone, especially when they play in the front yard in an area unfamiliar to me.


Any advice on social skills please? Or is this just something I have to deal with for my daughter?",N/A,N/A

My 11 year old (12 in August) is asking for Discord. She says her Roblox and school friends don’t have text messaging and that they’re on Discord. 

She doesn’t always have the strongest use / wisdom with boundaries, but she’s also a preteen recently surviving our (her parents’) divorce, and I’d like to isolate her from her friends as little as possible. I also try to help my children to *practice* boundaries and all of the difficult things in life and technology rather than banning them completely. I’m sure many parents here will disagree with that stance with varying intensities. 

I know nothing about Discord, so I’m about to watch some “what you should know about discord” videos and read some articles, but I’d like to know the opinions of maybe some more experienced parents, if someone would be willing to help. 

A) Should I help her to try Discord : practice boundaries, etc, or will it be too impossible for me to help her be safe? (I understand that all internet usage is potentially risky, which is why I say “help” her to be safe, not “guarantee”.)

B) If this is something I can reasonably monitor, how? The Google Family Link website says that it can’t monitor Discord, and I assume (again, I know 0% about it) that any inappropriate messages could just be deleted before I see them. 

PS : I allow my kids access to an old iPhone (that connects to Wi-Fi only) and a newer Android that’s fully functional, so I need to monitor them on different platforms. I understand that I’ll have to sometimes buy multiple parental control subscriptions to accommodate that.",N/A,N/A

Discord can be as wild and wooly as Reddit TBH but that said if you let her know you will randomly be reading chat logs, etc and checking the servers she is on, you can at least dive her a chance to try it.

If she wanders too far outside the proper lines THEN you can block discord with parental control apps and so on.  Kids need the chance to make mistakes and if we parents don't let them they will sneak off and make WORSE mistakes in my experience",idhyszg,N/A

You've got channels (aka like subreddits) where you can join things based on your interests, etc. I believe that once you put in a birthdate you can't change it - so if you set up her discord with her - she won't be able to access NSFW channels; but yeah - she can join channels that basically allow her to chat in a group function. 

Then you've got your DM's (private messages). You can set up her account so only her friends can private message her - and depending on your level of comfort you and her can set up rules that she can only accept friend requests from people she knows in real life/has talked to a few times on Roblox (that part I'd be a little iffy on, cause people can and do lie about their age on the internet). 

You can easily delete your own messages from Discord - but you can't delete other peoples. They have to delete their own messages. So - you could set up a rule that you are allowed to look at her discord at any time and ask her questions about what channels she's joined, any usernames you're suspicious of, if a conversation looks oddly one sided (like she's deleted messages) etc. I'd even go as far as to (at her age) log into her discord account on your computer/phone as well seeing as you can log in on multiple devices. 

I know there are a lot of problems with Discord - but they are the same problems you'd see on any other social media when it comes to kids. I think it's all about education, teaching them HOW to socialise and behave on these apps and then slowly giving them more freedom as they earn it. Like how you wouldn't immediately jump to going to Fiji for a month and leaving your kid/teen home alone - you'd (hopefully not do that at all!) work your way up to it and assess at each stage ""is my kid ready for more responsibility/freedom?""",idixwwz,N/A

It drives me crazy just how much she is staring at her phone, and the longer she is on, the grumpier she gets throughout the day. 
I usually have limits set on her device because she lacks the self control, 1 hour on tik tok, and an hour and a half on her other games. Mind you, I’m a gamer too, and I dont mind if she plays on our other consoles, she just chooses not to. 

Every morning her phone stays locked until she does her chores for the day. Yesterday started so well and we had some family emergencies so I decided to let her stay on roblox with her cousins most of the day. Thing is, I forgot to lock her phone at bed time like I usually do. I woke up to find out that she was on tik tok until 6:10 in the morning. 

I used to do this too. Not when I was 11 though. And I double checked, she was in fact online the whole time, I saw messages to her friends all the way to 6 in the morning.

AITA PLEASE HELP

I’ll apologize in advance. This is a long one but I need help. I struggled with drugs from the age 17-21. When I was 21, I left my whole shitty life and moved in with my mom, an hour away, to get clean. I stayed clean and volunteered at a local school, which is where I met my now husband. We will call him R for this story. I didn’t tell him about my past and we had a whirl wind romance. At the very start of our relationship, he warned me, he had an insane baby mamma. I’m a very passive and quiet person so I just thought it would be fine. We got married and I became a step mom to W. He was 2 at the time and we got along well. His mom, however, tried to chase me down on multiple occasions and fight me. She has always been very aggressive and petty. I have ALWAYS just shut my mouth and let things die out on their own. R and I got along very well and ended up having two additional kids. My second pregnancy was an awful one and I was given pain meds, which led to me relapsing. I eventually got caught and had my rights suspended from all the kids. The day I got caught, I went to rehab and worked my ass off to get my life back. Volunteering up to 8 times a week to drug test for 18 months and never failing one test. I started NA meetings in my county and eventually helped a ton of people get clean. 
(Sorry, I know this is long but I want to include everything to get a full story to everyone). 
She hated me before all that happened and now she REALLY hated me. Fast forward 6 years and my life is going great. My stepson and I are practically best friends. We stay up late and play the Xbox, we joke around and I truly look forward to seeing him. One day, I was logging my youngest son into Roblox and the password was both of my youngest sons names (they shared the account) and my step son heard me say the password. The next day, babymomma (BM), called my husband and asked him to come up and have a talk because something was wrong. My husband rushed there and W told him that I didn’t treat him fair and that he didn’t like me. I assume this is from the password. Which literally broke my heart. I was fully invested and couldn’t imagine a world where he could feel that way. I was hurt but I knew that this all came from hours of prying and searching from BM, looking for a reason. My husband and I sat down with W and brainstormed ways to make him feel more comfortable and we worked through it. 
More for the backstory: BM cheated on my husband with someone more than double her age. Literally only cared about money from the start. My husband, who is a very respected, smart, never even tried a cigarette, teacher of 10 years, wanted 50/50 custody  but this is a backwards county and they gave BM what she wanted. So now BM is with a very well to do man and they make a ton of money. While I work in a clothing store and husband teaches. We still have to pay her almost $500 a month even though we barely get by and she owns her home, brand new expensive cars, plastic surgeries etc. Our youngest kids get thrift shop clothes, while W is decked out in Yeezys. 
Anyways, everything settles down again and life continues. I’m reluctant to get really close with W again but we manage to live pretty normally. My husband heard about the new law where the parents default get 50/50 now and he decides to try to get W more so he takes her back to court. BM complains that I’m not fair to W and that W doesn’t want to be there when his dad isn’t there. Very far from the truth. They send someone in to talk to W alone and W says he doesn’t like me and basically verbatim what BM says. PLEASE understand that I loved this child the absolute best I could. We haven’t even had a disagreement. I was always very conscious about what’s fair and what’s not. This is out of no where and the judge commented that my husband is lucky that he didn’t get time taken away. My husband is devastated as well and knows Im not mean or unfair. I’ve never disciplined W or even raised my voice at him. But I need to stress that this is a very backwards small town and now I fear what lengths they will go to, to get their way and have W and I never to be unsupervised. I’m afraid they will say whatever they need to and that it could effect my younger kids and I. Having had problems in the past, I’m already in a bad position. I’m mad and hurt. I don’t know if I can be around W again without bawling. I told my husband that we need to split. He says that until things cool down, maybe I should go somewhere else when W visits. He thinks we need therapy. We’ve been together for 10 years now and I love him very much but I feel uncomfortable and I know how vindictive BM is. Should I just walk away and save what I have from being ruined or should I stay and risk it for the sake of love? W is a very smart, funny boy but is slowly getting brainwashed and taught what to say to get ahead. I don’t think I’ll ever be comfortable around him again. And I would never make my husband chose between us. Am I an asshole for not being able to get past this? Husband keeps saying that I’m the adult in this situation and I need to make the effort.

I am generally not a strict parent and have trouble telling them off unless one or the other is likely to actually get hurt or if one is likely to really upset the other.

I know this isn’t always the best way to be, but that’s how I am. So when a child does something annoying (and keeps doing it regardless of what I do) I’m likely to ask them to stop a couple of times (I’ve long given up trying to reason or argue logic with them), distract them, bribe them and then, if they are still doing it, explode and give them a disproportionate punishment. It goes without saying that this isn’t the best approach and has mixed results.

So what is the right thing to do if they aren’t being naughty, but just annoying? I often feel I don’t know what is reasonable and what is not. I am considering a new tactic and wanted some feedback as to whether it’s weird, unreasonable, etc.

I love my seven year old. He can be so much fun and he is so full of energy. He is most likely autistic, I probably am, too. What ever he is doing he tends to commentate. It’s very annoying. He is playing Roblox at the moment and he keeps telling me about it. But he expects me to look and he looks over to check I am. 

We played a fair amount together today, we usually do. So I don’t feel guilty that I want to sit here, in the same room, and read some stuff. I want to read some news or some articles on a website. Maybe I want to write something, a blog post or some hobby coding. But I need to concentrate for more than 20 seconds at a time. I don’t want to stop several times a minute and see what car his roblox character is driving. 

Is it unreasonable to put headphones in and tell him, repeatedly if he keeps interrupting, that daddy is concentrating so stfu. (I wouldn’t actually say it that way 😝 ).",N/A,N/A

I generally practice gentle parenting, but like you, I sometimes get too lenient, and then I get kinda explosive . 

My daughter literally talks from the second she wakes up to when she falls asleep, no one can stand her for more than a few minutes. So I’ll be straight with her and be like “hey, your annoying me. Can I get a little break” 

We also tell our kids we are “off duty” so I’ll go to my room and just say “moms off duty, go to your dad if you need something” 

And if I have a project I don’t want to be interrupted in (for example today I was hanging a shelf) I’ll tell the kids “hey I’m about to go hang this shelf, it will take me like 30 minutes. I’ll be off duty the whole time, only come to me if it’s an emergency”— but giving them a little heads up seems to help a lot. 

But here’s the thing, we are trying to prepare our kids for the world, and in the world, if you are being fucking annoying, people are going to get annoyed with you, and that’s just life. So I don’t think there is anything wrong with calmly saying “hey you’re bugging me, I’m working on something, I’ll check out your Roblox cars when I’m done having my own time”",i0jpj7m,N/A

My son will also check to make sure I’m watching, whether he’s playing a game or showing me a video. He also makes me answer questions to make sure I’m paying attention. If he shows me a drawing or comic and I tell him I like it, he asks what my favorite part is. 

He’s just super excited about his hobbies. He wants to share his excitement with anyone and everyone. Keep in mind that a kid like this is gonna face some social rejection, even though his interests may be popular with other kids, because he lacks the social awareness and impulse control to understand that most kids don’t make friends by info-dumping at each other. So it’s important that you teach him how to hold a proper conversation, along with how to tell if someone is bored or annoyed. Also important that you seek out places for him to share his excitement with people in an environment where his enthusiasm will be appreciated— clubs, leagues, classes, conventions, etc. The more he gets to channel his interests into opportunities for learning and social connection, the less his excitement will manifest as unwanted behavior or internal shame. 

You want to be careful not to be your kid’s first bully, either. Just because you want your kid to stop annoying you doesn’t mean you have to make them feel bad for it. Teaching a lesson in the moment should generally be avoided, because you’re likely to be impatient and your kid is already distracted. The only message they’ll be taking away is that you wanted them to stop talking. Instead, when you want to concentrate, take preventative measures: Schedule your quiet time to take place after you’ve had good quality time with your kid, tell him what to expect and for how long (“I will be unavailable to watch or comment on anything for the next 30 minutes while I concentrate on X. If it’s not an emergency, please do not interrupt. I love you and it’s important for me to have this time to focus.”), and make this a regular practice. 

Spend time practicing social interactions with your kid regularly and suggest alternatives to talking for times when it’s inappropriate— like making a video, writing, or creating something with the topic as inspiration.

We often tell him to play on his own or watch his show on his own, that we don’t need to see every little thing. Or to play in a different room if he wants to continue talking about it.

I’ve never been good socially, so I struggle to teach him the right way to do these things, then add in last couple of are with Covid and lack of interacting. And he doesn’t stand a chance. It probably would help if he could let off the steam interacting with kids his own age.

Then return it back and tell her that her usage would be limited. 
Tell your ex that you will wean her off, probably she doesn’t want to do it and deal with tantrums, so if you’re up to it handle it yourself.

But that approach is hard for busy life, so I’d suggest setting some “chores” or things she needs to do before she can use it. Some suggestions are: 
1- eat breakfast 
2- brush teeth and dress for the day 
3- make bed
4- read for 15 minutes 
5- brain quest for 10 minutes or some other workbook activities 
6- outside time for 30 minutes (park would be great and she probably would want to take 2 hours lol, just tell her she should be outside for at least 30 minutes so she won’t feel overwhelmed)
7- feed pets (if you have any) 
8- she can use it 
9- make a rule that if she doesn’t stick to the schedule her iPad privileges would be taken away for the whole day. It always better if she helps with making the schedule and choosing her activities.

Then screens off about 2-3 hrs before bed (this worked greatly with me, started with 2 hours before bed now it’s 5 hours before bed)


Warning and Disclaimer: that child would scream bloody murder and would say harsh things like : I hate you, you don’t care about me, I’m gonna move to another house…. Etc just stay strong and ignore her tantrums, it gets better eventually.

try to implement other things her daily routine, perhaps reading, playing outside, etc. it doesn’t matter-> the most important thing with this is that YOU also need to be committed to the process as well. you can’t expect your child to not be attached to her iPad if daddy is also on his iPhone 23/7 (this leads to the “*parent* why can you be on the *insert electronic device* when I can’t be??”). so if you choose reading, then read with her - if you want her to go outside, play out there with her. remember that your role modeling is crucial in her developmental growth. we are all products of our environment - so start small and see how you can make changes to better the environment around you. ooooh - I just saw that she’s with your ex and her mother and they don’t monitor the screen time… in that case, it’s a little harder for you to assist in handling her screen time unless if your ex and her mom are also committed into helping her build healthy habits. but it’s the most important for whoever spends the most time with her. if you can all be on the same page about, you can do it for sure.
remember, the older your child gets and longer you let them mingle in the “I can do what I want” stage, the harder it will be for them to break these habits.

kinda off topic but not really, but everyone typically looks at drugs/alc to be bad - that you can be addicted to these items and they’re not good for you and that you need to be 18/21 to do these things… well research has shown that having electronics early also does the same - it releases the same chemicals and causes addiction (chemicals/dopamine from playing games, social media popularity, checking to see how many likes your picture has, etc.)... especially if you expose them to it very early. it leads you to be more involved on the device/phone, attending to a virtual relationship even when you’re physically meeting/visiting someone else. it showcases that you can’t go a few hours without your phone. so I implore you (and everybodyyy), please take a step outside, play board games, read, do group activities (even if it’s technology related, at least do it together), just try and reduce your screen time. 
technology has very much been beneficial in many ways but has hurt us in many ways as well. if we let it control us then it hinders our abilities to form meaningful relationships, as well as hurt our social skills. she’s still very young so you have time :)

Set limits (time limits per session and total for the day). She'll throw a tantrum for a while but then she'll learn. Enforce that tech time is a privilege and it can be taken away if she behaves badly. Get her lots of other fun things to do. Keep a stack of new books from the library handy, Lego and other kits (kind of like real Roblox?), get outside as much as possible, go for walks and bike rides, have playdates with her friends at the park. She just needs to get into a new routine and eventually the tantrums will stop.

My son lost tech time for a whole day and we went geocaching (which requires a phone app on MY phone, but I called that an exception).

Unfortunately the tantrum is something you’re going to have to deal with, probably for an extended period of time as she adjusts to not being given the iPad on demand.

1. Your kid is probably modeling you! How much time do you spend on the phone? I set up “tablet/computer time” for them but not for myself and one of them called me out on it. So now even me and hubby have to follow the schedule. They model what we do. 
2. You are probably not spending enough time with your kiddo. They get attached to their tablet/Roblox because there’s no other options and then it becomes their go-to entertainment. I have 7 year old twins and when I offer them ANY other options to do something WITH ME they’ll pick that over Roblox EVERY TIME. today we are making stuff with Perler beads and having a tea party. We have started playing Monopoly as a family when we’d normally all be off in separate corners on our devices. Save the unscheduled tablet time for times when you simply can’t be with your kid, like if you must do something for work or other have-to adult task. Get out there and interact with your kid!

Has worked amazingly.  He’s not bugging out during the week to play it, chores are getting done, and he still gets some play time with the devices.

But you need to stay adamant.  Don’t give in and let them play during the week and without doing their chores correctly.  It’s been a solid 3 months now and still working great.

After school they sit with me for a snack and we chat about their day (I think being social should come before screens and they seem to enjoy my attention), they do any homework and any of their chores that are to be done. THEN they have their screens while I cook dinner. We have no screens allowed at the table or when guests are over and they can’t fuss if they don’t get them one day for any reason (like if grandparents are round or we have dental appts or after school club). The screens are always the first thing to be taken away if a punishment is to be dished out (they either lose time or whole days depending on the severity) and we rarely have screens at weekends because that is family time and time for entertaining themselves in other ways. I think vegging out and being entertained is important, especially after a long day at school and screens are great for that but kids need to understand they are a privilege and they need to know how to amuse themselves, be social and enjoy their own company. It’s a fine line to balance and what works for us may not work for you but hopefully some of these tips might help. One other thing I’ve just thought of, I limit my own screen time when I’m around my kids and they always come first.

And youtube. I said hell no to tiktok. His problem is he gets mad and will scream bloody murder at the ipad if he dies in roblox or something. Here are my tips:

1) if not done already, require password for all new app installs and require passcode to unlock all the time

2) make the password & passcode something only you and SO know so they have to ask you to unlock it every time. Change it frequently because kids are sneaky.

3) when you unlock, give a specific amount of time to play (30 min/ whatever you are comfy with) set a timer and turn it off (lock it) when it goes off regardless of tantrums. Consistency is key.

4) inappropriate behaviour or content results in immediate turn-off and potentially loss of privileges for the rest of the day. If a specific app is an issue, let them know that if problems continue you will be removing that app and they will have to earn it back through good behavior.

5) depending on your wifi setup, if you can set time windows in the router or wifi repeater settings to only allow internet based apps like roblox for certain hours of the day for her device. Turn off cellular data if connected to a phone plan. 

6) Allow her other offline apps for play during wifi blackout, preferably ones with some sort of educational value. Geometry dash is fun game (with super annoying music) that allows players to build their own courses, so that is somewhat redeeming. There are plenty of others! 

I know my kid's problem isnt necessarily the ipad, but the games he is playing that results in issues (all fo which are internet apps). I'd prefer ABC mouse for 8 hrs than 20 minutes of roblox. Good luck!",h3p0ofz,N/A

In our house we had a ""handle it or I will handle it for you rule"" any time our kids wanted a new responsibility or freedom. It can apply to just about anything. When my son was around 7 and wanted to ride up to the park without his sister I gave him a watch and he knew what time he had to be home by. As long as he held up his end of the deal and got home when he was supposed to then I would hold up mine. The same went for when my daughter wanted me to loosen up on the computer time restrictions when she was 9 or 10. As long as she handled all of her responsibilities without having to be reminded, I wouldn't harp on her about her computer time. Whenever they didn't hold up their end of the bargain I would explain to them that I overestimated their ability to be mature and responsible so I needed to step back in. It wasn't treated as a punishment but my kids wanted to prove to us that they were mature, so we never really had any problems.",h3mzyqk,h3mxa8z

If you've got Netflix or Amazon Prime, they have so many shows that are actually ok to watch for both parents and kids. 
Netflix: I love Puffin Rock, Spirit, Numberblocks, Alphablocks, Octonauts, Storybots, and Word Party. None of these make me want to blow my brains out, like My Little Pony, or Blippi. Puffin Rock is legit relaxing. I've actually sat and watched that Puffin Rock without the kids for like 2 episodes before I realized they had wandered off.
Amazon Prime: Tumble Leaf, If You Give A Mouse A Cookie, Pete the Cat, The Stinky and Dirty Show. There's even more if you spring for the PBS channel. Tumble Leaf is also a decently relaxing show. 
Disney has Bluey, which I've heard is really good.
None of these shows have anything scary in them. There are some tense moments if your kid is sensitive, but nothing frightening. No monsters, no scary people. Just stuff like, ""How do we help the baby seal down from the ledge so she can get to dinner?"" And, ""How do we call for a lift from across the lake?""

I didn’t have any “evening” to even watch an hour or two of a show. I only had the weekends and even then not much time.

I once told my wife, I never get to watch anything I want because all of my shows have sex and crazy violence.

I think our solution was I just got to go to the room for a few hours on weekend to catch up a bit",hjmgjnf,N/A

I'm torn between not wanting my child glued to a tablet all day, yet being happy he has a way to stay close with his sister. 

SD is 9. ""Ours"" son is 4. SD is having to do summer school because Bio-mom insisted on homeschooling her for the last 2 years because of Covid - we were on board for the year before last but thought she should return to in person last year, but DH didn't want to fight with BM. Anyway, BM wanted to do it all herself and didn't send any of the work or curriculum when SD was here. Now SD is so far behind in math, she has to do summer school. Not really sure why it's so hard to teach 2nd grade math, but whatever. 

We usually have SD for the whole summer since BM doesn't live close and every other weekend visits would keep SD in the car for a pretty big chunk of time. Since SD has to do summer school, she can't come until June 26.

Our son absolutely adores his big sister. He thinks she hangs the moon and stars. It's really cute. She loves her little brother, too. So pretty much all evening and for a good amount of time on the weekends, they're video chatting through messenger kids and playing roblox together. 

Is it really so bad for him to be on his tablet so much if that's his only way of interacting with his sister?",N/A,N/A

When you consider screen time - the argument sometimes is that unnatural light, eye strain etc can be a problem.

But typically when people make the screen time argument - it's more related to not being outside, playing games, watching videos, bright and flashing lights. 

If this is his way to connect with his sister, I'd continue it because it's overall going to be more healthy for both of them. 

I would consider the following though:

1. Tablet time ends 2 hours before bedtime (as most will say the screen light can mess with sleeping). If they want to do a quick 2 minute say good night, ok with that, but not having him facetiming for two full hours before bedtime.
2. Have them move around - take the tablet outside, sit in the living room, walk around with it; vs just sitting in their bedroom on it. 

We live out in the country, no neighbors, my son (9) can't just walk a block and go hang out with his friends. He spends a lot of time on his tablet/xbox but the majority of the time he's talking with his friends and playing games with them, so for me the socialization aspect outweighs the screen time risks.",ich83iv,N/A

Actually age 5 - but she's been around adults more than children besides her daycare/preschool. So, we'll just say 5-7 range?

Justin and Adam or whatever. Noticing she likes really hyperactive people/sounds and stuff she finds.. humourous?

Movies - hardly any but she wants to watch horror movies. She likes a this Spirit Halloween YouTube channel. What are some good movies to start with? 

Music - she loves Machine Gun Kelly and girl music from the 90s-00s. Gwen Stefani and stuff. 

How do I open her up to new music and movies? AND what are some good YouTube channels you approve of.

Honestly, for now I would skip the youtube unless you can directly supervise her the entire time. The youtube kids algorithm is suuuper glitchy (see: r/ElsaGate) and personally it's not worth it to me to potentially expose younger kids (like under age 10) to whatever random people on the internet want to put out there. And not even necessarily violence or sex, but also negative comments about body image/beauty standards, seeing bullying or people interacting in unkind ways, racism/sexism/homophobia, etc. My niece, who was 8 at the time, was looking for Harry Potter Puppet Pals and the algorithm basically led her to a video where men paint their penises like puppets and make them talk to each other. Luckily she showed her dad who reported the video, and she was just weirded out, not traumatized or anything, but I think it goes to show that the algorithm is absolutely awful at weeding out things we don't want our kids to see.",idksn1j,N/A

im not well versed in child psychology but if he’s already willing to talk to you, you can probably show interest and get him going on about it enough that he’d reveal undesirable things without thinking too much about it. also doesn’t hurt to ask him what the server’s name is and give it a quick google, many servers have websites that list out their rules and all of that.

He plays on the Hypixel server, which has a lot of rules to try to create a safe environment. I’ve popped in and watched over his shoulder here and there and haven’t seen or heard anything inappropriate so far.
At one point he was also wanting to play “Among Us” and “Fortnite” but I vetoed those (mainly based on the fact that my high school students were playing those a lot at the time, and I know what kind of language they use). 
Unfortunately he has a chromebook for school and so he has access to a lot of free to play browser based games that I’m not always around to supervise. So far he has found some kind of fortnite-esque game (seems to be pretty limited though, so probably not nearly as popular), as well as a gaming called taming.io which so far seems to be ok. He’s even talked his little sister into playing that one with him occasionally.

I’d say. Watch him play, or even play with him for awhile. Get a feel for the game or server to see if it’s appropriate. If a game offers a way to turn off chat features, that’s a great thing to take advantage of.

And, talk to him about things he may encounter that you might not approve of. For instance, I expect my kids not to curse, but I do occasionally and my mother swears like a sailor. But, they know those are words for adults and they shouldn’t use them.",huxv7no,N/A

Using a handheld device will involve a lot more neck and wrist strain then having a device where you don't have to look down at your hands in order to utilize the device.

I have same stance on consoles over handheld gaming.

You can get Bluetooth keyboards and mice to hook up to a tablet in order to increase their functionality and ergonomics while keeping the flexibility of having something portable.",id69lgx,N/A

I have three kids - twin pre-teens and a third grader. 

I’m personally not very good with technology (especially for a millennial), and don’t use it for more than basic email, Reddit (obviously) and Netflix. But I’m coparenting with someone very familiar with and interested in technology who allows our kids lots of access. 

I tried to keep my house low-tech (only watching shows or movies together, otherwise off line), and since the kids don’t really have strong online friends / relationships, I felt okay about it. 

But sometimes I just really need a break or a nap (I work nights and then don’t have a babysitter the next day), so I started to allow them to play their games, like Among Us, Fortnite, and Roblox. I just got an email from my ex, though, that the kids are getting through his more extensive controls and talk about how to get through mine. (I didn’t even know I had controls, but apparently “restricted access” is automatically turned on in YouTube and is enough of a control that they feel like they need to mess with it.)

Can someone please tell me easy, effective ways to keep them safe online? I do mean easy, as so much of this is overwhelming for me. I don’t even know all of the things I should be blocking against, much less how. 

PS talking about trust, responsibility, etc, clearly does nothing, because that’s what I was trying to work with.

Our 11-year old owns a smartphone. Giving it to her was a bad decision. She got it a year ago, when all of her friends already had one, and we didn't want her to feel excluded. We chose a used Iphone and installed all the child protection there is, including limited screen time etc. 

12 months later, she has this thing like implanted in her palm. Apple's screen time limits don't work effectively, as she found ways of turning them off (changing system time etc) or using apps that cannot be limited at all (talking to you, Roblox). Even if everything is shut down, I caught her swiping the phone settings or her picture roll for hours on end.
She has a fixed screen time limit of 4 hours per day. When we checked the phone this evening, she had spent 6,5h on the Iphone. 

Our daughter is a happy and smart girl with a lot of friends, but we feel this cellphone ""addiction"" makes her more quiet, more isolated. It adds up with pre-teen behavior like lying in bed for hours with the blinds down (she hit puberty when she was around ten).

We long for a way to effectively cut down on her screen time. Taking the phone away altogether isn't really an option though - she needs to be able to call us up from school, and all the other kids in class use Whatsapp to communicate. We don't want to go that way.

Also, by believing she needs to contact you during school is actually reinforcing the need for her to have her phone. If a student needs to call their parent, they can go to the office.

If you fiddle around with parental controls and you both have an apple device, you can set her phone to basically lock itself at a certain time until the next day. There’s no way she can bypass that unless she’s got her own Apple ID and it isn’t an account that you actively control through family settings or something similar. I’d also recommend changing the code that you use for your parental settings as well as the passcode that allows her to purchase things.

Bare with me here as I try not to rant per se, but instead voice concern. Background story:

My 6.5 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD/ODD not long after his sister was born 2 years ago. He started acting out a lot, which I expected with so much attention going to new baby. But before she was born, my son was interested in everything. Working in the garage with me, playing outside and getting dirty, etc.  Now he’s just not interested in hardly anything! A few examples: his great grandfather played for the STL Cardinals, his grandpa nearly went pro, I almost went pro. Baseball is something he has been exposed to since he was born, but when we signed him up, he didn’t care for it. We tried soccer, nothing. I’ve grown up around race cars, race tracks, owned race cars, and it’s a huge part of my life. He’s not interested in it the least bit. I’m not bitching that we don’t share interests, but he’s not interested in most things kids should be interested in (these are things he WAS interested in before sister)… I just remember being a kid and loved going to play outside, get dirty, go to games, races, etc. All he wants to do is get on his tablet, video games, TV, and snack. Due to this, we’ve limited his screen time. We had hobbies, played sports, did things. He’s just so unmotivated to learn anything I try to teach him, do anything new, etc. Is this normal?",N/A,N/A

Hi fellow parents - I’m in need of some detached, less emotionally charged advice. On mobile, so please forgive format errors.

My DD (let’s call her Abby) is almost 14. She doesn’t have a phone, social media or much of an online presence. She has a tablet and uses a messaging app to keep in contact with her friends and cousins. But she is NOT much of a texter and doesn’t love communicating that way, preferring to call or video chat. This is important.

Enter her step-cousin. Without going into details, my niblings dad remarried and my niblings have a stepsister, and she was immediately ‘adopted’ as a niblings, grandchild, part of the family. Unfortunately, the girl (let’s call her Ella) has a lot of mental health issues, quite likely bipolar (although official diagnoses can’t be given until she’s 18). She’s had several psychotic breaks and spent a portion of time in the last year in the hospital, and is in therapy, and has a lot of medications to help her.

Yesterday, out of the blue, Ella texted Abby, posting angry emojis and yelling at her bout what a horrible person she was and how she’s a bad friend. There were about 8 texts from Ella, and Abby didn’t know what to do, and came to me near tears.

My favourite lines were ‘Wow, you are never there when I need you!’, ‘Haven’t you noticed i haven’t been running to you to talk about my problems?’, ‘Do you even care I’ve been in the hospital - oh right, you don’t even care to ask!’ (Side note, the hospital stays were completely hush hush, and none of us has any idea even though we are in contact with our niblings and BiL/SiL).

Immediately I was mad. But I’m not unbiased, this girl had caused a LOT of drama. I’ve always tried to excuse it, and explaining Ellas actions as being a reflection of her own insecurities and that Abby is not a bad friends or person just because she doesn’t text as often as Ella thinks she should.

I’m thinking of blocking Ellas number on Abbys devices and removing her from her any games they are friends on (mine craft, roblox,etc). And quite possibly from my younger daughters devices as well, since Ella immediately started texting my younger DD to freak out about Abby, and caused her stress as well.

I’m not sure what to do here. I really don’t want to involve Ellas mom because she’s convinced that her daughter can do no wrong and is always a victim, so I won’t get anywhere with her. Help?",N/A,N/A

I appreciate ou saying that 14 is not old enough to fully understand mental illness. She is certainly old enough to understand my anxiety and mild depression, but when she has someone who is nice and sweet one second and literally screaming and bawling and being violent the next, it gets hard.

Any thoughts on letting your young child play Roblox?  

My second-grader keeps bugging me about this game.  From what I can tell, it's like an MMO version of Minecraft, with player chats and everything.  Youtube videos of Roblox are . . . well, they could be described in many ways, but they seem pretty adult themed.  My understanding is that young players are sort of placed into a sandbox version, though I'm not clear if that is an entirely separate game space or the normal game space with a lot of filters around them.

I'm seen a few mentions of the game here in /r/parenting.  Mostly complaining about how consuming the game is.  

I don't want to come off as an over-protective hand-wringer, but raising our kids to handle online interactions safely and responsibly  is probably something we should all be concerned with.

I have 7 and 8 year old boys. They have tablets they play a few games on. Mainly roblox and Minecraft. They have chores around the house and I give them each a $10/week allowance. When we first made this agreement, I imagined them learning to budget, saving money for toys they would want, etc. I talked to them (in age appropriate terms) about saving, spending, investing, etc. I really wanted this to be a lesson about the value of money and the beginning of a financial education for them. 

What it has quickly become is them spending their money on robux every week. At first, I thought it’s the money they’ve earned, they can spend it how they want, and I was hoping they would get their fill and move on. Now, I feel more and more like I’m just throwing $80 in the trash every month*. I was never really into gaming, but my husband is. I’m not opposed to spending money on games for access to certain things. What I don’t understand is buying achievements to advance levels (isn’t that the point of playing the game?), or buying outfits and accessories for characters. 

I honestly worry about the long lasting effects this will have on them, like creating a false sense of achievement, low frustration levels, etc. I also don’t want them to feel like they’re missing out on something and they are technically earning their money. So I wanted to see what other parents do and how every one feels about game currencies and virtual goods.",N/A,N/A

If 2 kids get $10 a week in allowance, how are you getting from $20 to $80?  Sorry if I am nitpicking a tiny point here.  But if there's an additional $60 doing somewhere, well I'd say cut that out for sure.

How long as it been this way?  My 8 year old has had an allowance for about a year, and at the beginning he was so excited to do things like by gems in crappy ipad games, etc.  And so I let him.  But then we might end up at Target and he wants to buy a toy but there's no allowance left.  Too bad, so sad, maybe next week.  The problem solved itself in 3-4 months, and now he very rarely buys stuff like that, and often if he thinks he wants to, he decides to 'sleep on it' for a day and see how he feels tomorrow.

I pay his allowance through a bank account app called Greenlight, which automatically splits his allowance into spend, save and give categories based on a % that he and I agreed on.  He gets a debit card with it, and I can manage where he can spend with that card through either whitelisting or blacklisting.  You can even put budget caps on certain categories!  In the save, you can set specific goals like a Pokemon Elite Trainer Box (guess how many times per day I hear that phrase??).  So you could get their allowance done through Greenlight, talk with them about % for the categories, and then talk about any goals they have for larger purchases.  Then, help them structure spending limits on Robux to support them meeting their goals.  Downside is this bank account costs about $5 per month, but for me, I have seen payoff that viewing his money this way is worth it.",htn7p49,N/A

On something like Minecraft, maybe. As it's usually for skins or mods or something. Something that I'm more sure she will use multiple times because she will play Minecraft again and it's usually for ALL of Minecraft not just one specific map. Or at least what she's asked for. 

Sometimes, she will want to buy a full version of a game she plays as some of just basic versions. So I consider that. But I'd rather buy her a brand new game instead of something in a game.",htmzaf8,N/A

If you want, tell them they need to save 25% of what they “earn” and you will track it in an “savings account” (or a real one) they can see monthly when you show them statements.

The kind of thing like gems in a game or Robux are like my very least favorite type of spending for my kid to do.  I agree that it literally just feels like dumping money down the drain.

If it’s just for Minecraft, just about any old phone or tablet should be able to play it, though, and if you’re tech savvy enough, most newer TV’s have the ability to mirror your phone’s screen.

My third grade daughter came home yesterday and was acting off.  I did some digging and it came out that she is really struggling with friends at school.  We had experienced this before, but felt she had built a core group of friends and things were improving, but last night broke my heart and honestly, some advice from people outside the situation would be so greatly appreciated.  

For some context, we are very fortunate that she gets to attend a prestigious private school.  The education she receives is exemplary.  I realize what a privilege this is. But with that, comes a bunch of downsides I really don’t know how to deal with and honestly have surprised me.  We are well enough off, but we try to keep that from the children.  We don’t believe in putting a focus on money and material things.  For example, we live in a nice house, but not a mansion like many of the kids that attend.  We drive normal cars.  We don’t have a nanny.   We are also strict about tablet/screen time.  We don’t allow much of it, and things like TikTok and regular YouTube are off limits without parental supervision.  Sometimes we will save videos to show her, but she isn’t allowed to just scroll TikTok.  She is allowed to play Roblox with friends, and to FaceTime/text with them, but in limited amounts of time.  This alone makes us the “weird” parents.  These kids are 8 and 9 years old, have unlimited access to screens and things like TikTok(confirmed by speaking to some of the parents themselves), they watch things like squid games and the purge.  I sometimes check her iPad and will see friends playing Roblox at 11 at night on a school night.  We are the bad guys for not allowing stuff like this, but honestly that isn’t the biggest issue at hand.  We have explained different families have rules and created ways for her to earn extra screen time, and she seems fine with that.  

I have read all the stuff on bully proofing your kids and we do our very best to live up to those.  My daughter is mainly friends with boys, she gets on well with the girls but she is a bit of a tomboy and is really into anime, so she doesn’t have as much in common(or we haven’t found that common ground yet).  

So now that there is some background, here are some examples of issues we have had:

1. One kid that was essentially her best friend, out of the blue, tried to make fun of her for living in a one story house and called her a liar for saying she lived in a two story house.  We are currently in an Airbnb while we are remodeling our house, and it is a one story house.  He goes and uses this to make fun of her with other kids in their friend group.  Ideally I would like her to realize that the house you live in doesn’t matter, but rather how you treat people is more important.  I believe she knows this deep down, but she still feels embarrassed at being called a liar.  This kid lives in what I would call a small mansion, and his parents have legit fuck you money.  

2.  Another kid has told her “she fucking sucks” at gaming.  He also calls her names like simp.  When he realized I heard him do this once, he immediately told her she was lame for “telling” me.  It makes her terrified of me going to the school or telling his parents.  While that is exactly what I want to do, I also don’t want to do something that will in turn result in her not coming to me with these issues.  

3.  We lost a baby halfway through a pregnancy in December, which was obviously hard for our family.  The kid from the example in 1, has called her a liar over this and used it to make fun of her.  


I’m so terrified that going to the school will result in her being labeled a tattletale, further ostracize her and keep her from telling me.   I feel guilty that our house rules, even though I know they are based on  sound principles, leave her feeling as if she doesn’t get to do what her friends do.  I have tried to encourage her to try branching out her friend group, explaining she may have more in common with others than she realizes.  I just want to selll our home, move to the country and homeschool, but I know that isn’t necessarily the answer.  

And help or insights would be so appreciated.",N/A,N/A

There’s always going to be kids like this around whether they’re rich, or not. There’s literally no escaping it. You have to teach your daughter how to ignore these statements, and to not engage. The moment she gives away that this bothers her, the more they’ll do it. 
So she needs to stop trying to be friends with those kids. If she lets them bully her any longer without standing up for herself, I promise you they’ll never stop. 
So, my advice is to teach her how to stand up for herself, and explain to her that there’s always going to be people who think they’re better than you. 
The reality is that these bullies just aren’t good people who are miserable in their life, so they have to make other people feel bad too. 
Help her with her feelings, and explain to her that these spoiled kids are like this due to all the freedom their parents have given them at such a young age. Try to explain to her that they always got what they wanted, and have probably never been told NO so it made them mean, ungrateful, and hard to be around. 
I would just remind her that nice things aren’t important because at the end of the day stuff is just stuff, and when that’s taken away you are left with just yourself. 
Keep reminding her that being a kind person, and treating people how you want to be treated IS IMPORTANT. I hope this helps.",hugh8gr,N/A

If it's any consolation, I don't think your daughter watching Squid Game or staying up late prevents any of those events from happening.  While the missing the content of this show or that TikTok might leave her a bit out in the wind, the reality is that it's not completely about the content.  It's about showing off to each other what they can get away with doing and how ""old"" they are.  It's a vicious cycle for them and with the wealth to back up some of the risks they take, things will get bad for those kids.

This is not an easy age for kids as they are starting to grow and finding themselves, figuring out what they do/don't like, etc.  While she can't control others' actions, she can control how she responds to it.  She can be honest, tell them the one-story house is temporary.  They may not believe her, but that is on them, not her.  Perhaps talk with her about walking away with her head held high.  She doesn't have to listen to them to know who she is, that she is valued and loved, and from what I've read, way more than some of those other kids.  Maybe help her find other groups to find friends in.  Is there a gaming group in town? Is there a sport she likes, does she play an instrument, dancing, or some other hobby?  Would she like something like Girls Scouts perhaps?  Perhaps do a little research in the school and community, then together guide her to consider joining one or two.

And I so agree with the entitled little shits comment.  Though I try to remind myself these kids face their own struggles that manifest for various reasons, I still have moments I would like to punt them to the moon. Do you have any tips on how she might better be able to stand up to them?   Sometimes I wonder if we have drilled home the idea of not acting better than someone that it has made her doubt if she should stand up for herself.  We never wanted her to be a bully, or brag about the things we have.  My husband and I both grew up very poor, but think we learned so many valuable lessons in those hard times that we wanted to make sure our children understand those same things.  But maybe we have failed to teach her that there are people out there who will do exactly that.  We are really focusing right now on making sure her self esteem is on a solid foundation.  It just takes a lot to make her angry enough to fight back, and she tends to just feel sad about it.  I feel like I have left her vulnerable because I didn’t even really consider the fact other people wouldn’t want to teach their kids those same things, and I just have to shake my head at how utterly naive that has been.",hugmvgh,hugh8gr

I have spent so much time researching on the impact screens have at a young age, it’s just something I feel very strongly about.  

Honestly I feel a bit bad for these kids, because I really feel like they are being set up to fail in many ways and it’s really not their fault at this age that they have no boundaries or that they just get pawned off on a tablet so the parents don’t have to parent.  I tried to explain to her that acting older isn’t cool by using the example of myself and asking if I tried to act older by using a walker or cane if it would be cool, that we just need to celebrate the age we are because it’s the only time we will ever be that age again.  Sometimes I think maybe I’m asking her to try to understand concepts that are impossible to comprehend with the amount of big emotions she is experiencing, and I try to remind myself that when you are that age, school and friends make up the bulk of her life.  

I will also try and do a better job of embracing her likes more.  I mean I support them and while I can recognize a few characters she likes - I am by far not the anime expert she is.  Maybe by involving myself in it more she won’t need to rely as much on friends validation of it and they can bond on other shared interest.

School right now itself is kind of weird because of COVID.  The already small classes are smaller than before, they have assigned lunch seatings, and don’t get to interact on the grade level with each other so some good friends we had made previously are in different classes.  So in my daughters class of 12, four of the boys and one other girl have the kind of unlimited access to stuff that I have verified.  One of the boys has actually been amazing, and I shouldn’t just bring up the bad stuff, and I’m grateful he has stood up for her and vice versa.  I definitely think asking her what kind of friends she wants is a good question I haven’t asked yet, so thank you for that so much!

Bullies acquire authority but never moral legitimacy. They know their power is unjust and fragile. I think if she states facts, says it like it is, then it’s not being a bully. It’s just the truth. Whatever mean thing they have to say to her she can always say something like, “ You are a bully and I’m not afraid of you. You make fun of me because you have nicer things than I do, but I feel sorry for you. I hope you find peace in your heart, and learn to love yourself. Misery loves company. Your words don’t bother me. I love my family, and everything they have given me.“

Something along those lines. 
Teach her to be more confident by practicing scenarios with her. Give her more than one response she can use. Tell her what they are saying isn’t true, and they are just getting under her skin. Teach her to ignore it.

The more she responds in this manner I think they will get bored, and move on eventually.
I have also come from a poor family, and though I didn’t go to a rich private school I have dealt with rich kids before, and this worked for me.

We're somewhat new to our area -- moved from MD to NJ in the middle of the lockdowns. After a year we feel like we've met just about everyone there his to meet in our town.

But we don't live in a town where kids run back and forth to each other's homes. Partly because of the roads (no sidewalks) but also it just seems like we're never contacted by the parents of our kids' friends to do a play date outside of those planned type events.

Has the ""play date"" died since covid? Or is hit just that we're not being asked to play? We feel very insecure. Our 8 year old cries because he never has any friends to play with at home. We have a few kids on our street that are in our class, and he plays roblox with them daly. He wants to just run down to their houses and knock on the door but we feel weird letting him do that because he's yet to be invited by the moms of those kids.

Even with school friends not living close, the kids would usually arrange things at school, and then ask me (ie ""Johnny and I want to go play on his trampoline on Thursday after school, can I go home with him and you pick me up at 6pm?""), and I'd say fine as long as I had the other mom's number.",hmeimzm,N/A

50 yo dad, 20 yrs married, one child here. My wife (M.) is the same age. Our daughter (S.) is 10 and - from a 20,000-foot view at least - is happy and well-adjusted; smart, social, and creative; reads voraciously; does well in school; has lots of friends.  We're very proud of her.

This past year, she has been spending way too much time (hours a day) playing games; it started with an intense interest in Minecraft (which I didn't mind so much as it was clearly a fairly rich creative outlet) but these days is more centered around Roblox and various freemium iPhone games, which I dislike because they don't seem to require much creativity or skill and I get the sense that a lot of them exist only to gull players into spending money to collect in-game items.   She also watches game-related YouTube channels.   We've been reluctant to restrict her game/screen time too much as due to the pandemic it is her main social outlet (she is lucky enough to attend school in-person but has no playdates, after-school activities, and the like, so she meets with friends online).  Judging from conversations with her friends' parents, this is a pretty universal concern today, and I'm hoping once the pandemic is over she'll broaden her spectrum of activities again.

She also can be very flippant and argumentative with M. (not so much with me). They have multiple contretemps daily, mostly around screen time, food, dress, and a few other subjects; I usually wake up to a loud argument about what S. can have for breakfast or what's appropriate for her to wear, or whether she is allowed to go online before school.  These aren't big, knock-down fights, more like loud squabbles, and usually end pretty quickly, but there are a lot of them, always on the same themes, and they do get on my nerves.

All in all, though, I don't see my daughter showing any major, pervasive behavioral problems.  I imagine arguments over screentime, dress, and food are pretty universal with preteens today.   I am concerned, though, about the fact that M. and S. have taken to sharing a bed in S.'s bedroom.  In the past, it was not uncommon for them to lie down together at S.'s bedtime to read, watch episodes of various series, or listen to audiobooks on M's laptop, and M. would often fall asleep there, but always wake up and come back to our bedroom in the middle of the night.  About a year ago, though, M. started spending the whole night, every night, in our daughter's bed; I sleep alone in the master bedroom.  This was never discussed, and M. never gave me a clear reason for it; it just suddenly became the norm. I have brought it up on multiple occasions and M. always brushes my questions aside; she simply refuses to acknowledge the situation -- often she'll just say ""mmmhmmm"" in lieu of answering me.  If I ask her point-blank why she is sleeping there, she says something vague about S. being afraid of the dark (she isn't, so far as I can tell, and was sleeping on her own for years before this); if I ask her to please at least come back to our bedroom once S. is asleep, she answers in a noncommittal way, then just continues sleeping there.  I've stopped bringing it up because to do so seems to be fruitless.

To be clear, because obviously this would be the primary concern: I do not think that there is anything abusive happening here. I don't see any signs at all of that. Nevertheless, I am (unsurprisingly) not happy with the arrangement, nor with M.'s unwillingness even to discuss it.  I'll put aside my own need for intimacy here; to be honest, that wasn't being fulfilled even when M. and i were sleeping in the same bed; we were intimate about once a year, and I had pretty much given it up for a lost cause a long time ago. I'm more concerned about potential effects on my daughter, but I'm not even sure if I should be worried or not.  I feel like I need a reality check here - with the pandemic, not seeing other families, it feels a bit like living in a hermetically-sealed unit, and I'm kind of losing a sense for what's normal and what's not.  Hence my post. 

Outwardly, as I said, S. is doing pretty well.  I have a sense, though, that her constant bickering and squabbling with M. is the other side of the coin from their sleeping together; to me, both things are signs that the whole mother-daughter relationship is a little unhealthy, almost too close, if that makes any sense. I feel like boundaries that should be present in the parent-child relationship (at age 10, at least) are missing.  A parent should be able to tell a child: ""sorry, no more playing with my phone"" and actually take it away if she doesn't put it down.  Instead, they will go on for a half-hour or more with M. constantly telling her to put the phone away and S. coming up with excuses not to   It's exhausting to listen to, and when I step in and just take the phone away, M. is upset that I'm being too harsh.  Similarly, I feel like ""this is what's for dinner tonight, eat it or go hungry"" is a reasonable parental stance (making allowances obviously for cases where a kid really doesn't like a particular food); S. knows that she can, with enough wheedling, usually get M. to give in and let her have something else.  On occasions that M. has been away (hasn't happened recently, of course) S. has always just eaten what I cooked for dinner, no questions asked. 

I also worry that we're setting a very poor example for S. about what a healthy husband-wife relationship is like.  When she grows up, if she gets married and has children is she going to end up sleeping in their bed, to her husband's (probable) dismay?  When I was a teen, I had a close friend who admitted to me that, growing up, he'd been horrified by the fact that his mother and father slept in separate rooms, to the extent that he was loath to have friends sleep over lest they find out this dark secret. I've never forgotten that (especially as my friend had a lot of emotional baggage to work through and ended up committing suicide as a young man).  And a husband and wife sleeping in different rooms doesn't even seem all that egregious to me (maybe one of them snored?), though I certainly would have found it odd back then. I have visions of my daughter talking to friends, or sleeping over once the pandemic is over, and suddenly realizing that it's not the norm for a mother to sleep with her 10-year-old every night. Not to mention, if she ever ends up mentioning it to anyone, they might indeed look askance.

Honestly, our family life is not too bad.  M. and I have a good marriage in most respects -- physical intimacy is, sadly, a distant memory, but other than that we are reasonably close; we discuss things, don't bicker all that much, and can come to agreement or compromise on major life decisions.  I'm not lying when I tell her I love her, and I believe she loves me too.  But at the same time, if someone had told me 20 years ago that my wife would end up sleeping in our 10-year-old daughter's bed every night, I would have thought it ridiculous, completely unacceptable.  Am I off-base here, or is this something I should just accept and not worry about?  If not, *what can I do to address it without making things worse?*

[Edit: to be clear, I am not soliciting advice about my relationship with M. *per se* - I know, I know, ""marriage counseling,"" the answer for every relationship question.   I'm asking about the *parenting* aspect of this.  Do I need to worry about the effect this will have on our daughter? If I can go to M. with some concrete evidence that this is not a good thing for our daughter, instead of just saying that I'm unhappy with the situation, I think she will be willing to change her behavior.]",N/A,N/A

If she’s trying to be closer to your daughter, open up a conversation with her about it. How is she feeling about her daughter growing up? Is she realizing that closeness with her daughter like that is limited, might be coming to an end soon, and might be mourning that? 

I can’t make any assumptions about your case in particular, but I have a friend who intentionally sleeps with her ten year old daughter because she doesn’t want to have sex with her husband. She doesn’t want to have sex with him because she’s carrying the emotional load (“running” the household) of the family and has lost attraction to him because of that.

I've always been anxious about things like weather and thunderstorms and after the tornado I started experiencing full blown panic attacks and anxiety. The next summer I spent SO much of my time checking the weather channel like obsessively. If it would get cloudy or rain I'd have a panic attack, if it stormed my mom had to sleep with me. This was the summer before high school. I'd pack a bag with clothes, chargers, food and keep it in the basement in case. My mom was amazing when I went through this. She would talk to me, ask me what I felt when I had an attack, what happened all that. And when she slept in my room I felt safe. I wished she could sleep with me every night but of course i knew that wasn't healthy. 
All of this to say, there's a pandemic. A worldwide virus that has affected practically every inch of the world. Our lives have completely done a 180. Life as we knew it probably won't ever be the same. She's still a child coping with this MONUMENTAL change not just to her, her friends, her teachers, her parents, her family, all of it. If this happened a year ago, then yeah maybe she's anxious. Maybe she's feeling scary thoughts about the world and understanding things have changed and not necessarily for the better. If her mom makes her feel safe and secure then that's okay. Of course she's getting older, but I'd have a talk with your wife about what's really going on. Is it anxiety, is it some other sort of mental health issue that needs to be addressed. And also ask her why she is unwilling to bring it up to you. Maybe your daughter is embarrassed but clearly it's affecting your marriage too so this should be a family discussion. Maybe go to a family counselor to get to the bottom of this? 
Of course your primary concern is your daughter. I'd try finding out why she needs her mom to sleep with her every single night. Maybe after you guys all talk it can become a once a week thing if she truly needs it. 
Secondly, I'd be worried about why your wife is keeping something from you regarding your daughter. Are they scared of you? Are they worried you would react unfavorably? I would definitely address that. Maybe she's unhappy, maybe she is going through something and you haven't pushed to find out what. Just seems like a lack of communication on all parts.

I hate to be blunt but what does this have to do with your daughter? This is a parenting subreddit, but ultimately your issue and concern seems to be with your wife.

Just read your edit. Is your daughter going to end up screwed up because her mom is in her bed? Probably not. In less developed places around the world it isn’t uncommon for families to share a single bed.

But if your wife and daughter are having constant “tiffs” it probably is pretty irritating that she doesn’t even have her own bed to herself. If you can afford it... she should have her own space.

Back to the relationship, your wife spending every night in her daughters bed is not normal. If the two of you are having problems and she’s hiding away with your daughter... THAT isn’t healthy for your daughter. EVEN if your daughter isn’t aware of the issues, your wife using her as a way to avoid the conflict with you... it’s going to put undue burden on your child.",gu6tss5,N/A

I also note that you've tried to directly ask M. about it, but I wonder if you should go for a full sit-down conversation where you're entirely blunt about your concerns, as it carries a slightly higher level of seriousness to it. It is completely valid to be concerned. This doesn't have to be a fight or a confrontation, but you should be able to have a conversation with your partner where you say, ""I need to talk to you about this and I need to clearly understand your reasons. I don't feel okay with what's currently going on and we need to talk about it."" If you can't do that, then I'm afraid I've gotta go with the other commenters recommending marriage counselling.

And I have to be honest here: I don't think you should entirely rule out the possibility of abuse. I'm not saying there's something going on - only that you should remain observant and continue to assess things to the best of your ability.

The arrangement will likely not last once your daughter gets into full preteen mode and will undoubtedly want space. Space is healthy. 
I don't necessarily think it's a harmful thing for now. Co-sleeping is something many families do to a certain age. I often bunk with one of my kids but only every now and again when husbands snoring is unbearable.

This is her baby. She’s used to being so loved and needed by her but sees how she is growing up and moving away from her a bit (as is normal). Your wife might also be wondering what life on the other side of parenting looks like. 10 is around when you start to get some freedom back. What will life be like when she’s not needed in the same way as she was when she was parenting a very young child? Perhaps she’s scared or sad about that. 

Sleeping with her is a way to feel close again. And connected. I bet she’s trying to hold on to that closeness as much as she can. 

I wouldn’t worry about your daughter and any developmental issues from sleeping with her mom at this age. Lots of kids do for lots of reasons. I slept with my mom frequently until around 12/13. I’m successful and independent. My mom and I have a close but normal/non codependent relationship. 

I’d approach your wife with non judgement, curiosity and compassion. Try to dig a bit and see what’s going on. Perhaps counseling for her, or maybe more socializing with friends or a new hobby might help.",gu7icvy,N/A

My mom and dad divorced when I was 4 years old. My older sister basically became the second parent to my twin brother and I. And in a non-sexual way of course, essentially became my mother’s husband. All of the troubles and burdens my mom had to deal with as a poor and single mother were also the burdens of my sister. All of my mom’s emotional problems became my sisters as well. When we were living in apartments without enough room, they shared a bedroom. Even at one point when everyone had their own room, my mom still ended up sharing with my sister. 

It’s called codependency. And it took its toll on all of us. For me, as I got older, I felt that I needed to take on financial responsibility in our household—and ended up giving my mom a lot of money that I had made and saved responsibly to cover bills and other expenses. And I felt like I was allowed to move out on my own or else my mom would suffer.

Your daughter needs her own space and privacy. Period. Your wife needs to grow up and get out of your daughter’s room. It is absolutely unhealthy for both of them. But especially for your daughter who is growing up and learning. 

I agree with everything that you have stated above, so you are not out of line or crazy. And it’s probably going to end up being a heated argument, but you need to put your foot down on the sharing a bed/bedroom.",gu7lpos,N/A

As far as the arguing, I do think you need to get on the same page. My bigger concern outside where people sleep is proper boundaries. I’m not harsh but when I set rules, we don’t argue. I learned a great phrase from love and logic “asked and answered” the kids don’t love it but it’s taught them that once I’ve responded I’m going to stick with it, no electronics tonight really means no electronics.

You need to talk to your wife and daughter with an open mind.  Don't approach it like they're doing something wrong.  That will put them on the defensive.  Instead, try to understand both of their perspectives on what is going on.

I think I'm a pretty interactive dad, certainly not just a spectator.  My daughter and I used to spend much more time playing and doing things together than we do today (and I miss that time!) but a lot of it, I assume, is just a natural outgrowth of her preferring to spend time with friends (which, these days, means online in video games) rather than with her parents.  We still do have quality time together, she confides in me, and she is not hesitant to approach me (or I her).  And both my wife and I participate in parenting.  We're pretty good about agreeing on rules and limits (screen time, etc.) and respecting each other's dictates when they are set separately (e.g. if I say that S. can't do something, or has to do something, then M. will enforce that, and vice versa).  To the extent that we're not adequately enforcing limits on video gaming etc. - we're both in agreement on what those limits should be, and we're both at fault for not enforcing them enough; it's just hard to do when it's S.'s only social outlet, and both M. and I get busy with work etc. and it's sometimes just the easiest path to let S. play.

The sleeping issue is the main thing.  I actually suspect that it's not that my wife doesn't want to sleep with me (I mean, she clearly doesn't want to *sleep with* me, but I don't think that she has an objection to sleeping in the same bed as I do -- she wouldn't choose the couch over that), but rather that she *does* want to sleep with our daughter.   That's what I am trying to get to the bottom of - why, and does it potentially pose a problem for our daughter's development, or should I just accept it.   I would agree that S. deserves to be able to sleep by herself if she wants to, but if you asked her, she would certainly say that she wants her mother there.",gu6il3p,gu6g4fa

Do you happen to know if, in your friend's case, it has had a negative effect on her daughter? 
 
If this is just a matter of being close to S. before it's ""too late,"" and if it's not likely to be harmful to S.'s development, then I'm not going to press the issue.  Indeed this is more or less how I've been reassuring myself over the past year - that there's nothing untoward about them sleeping together, it's just an indication of how close they are.  The reason I'm getting concerned, as I said in the original post, is that the constant squabbling seems like the ""other side of the coin,"" that they're almost getting too close, that parent/child boundaries that should be present at this age (e.g. the ability of a parent to say ""no"" effectively) are lacking.

I already know that my wife doesn't want to have sex with me -- as I said, we were essentially never intimate even before this started.  She may very well be tired of carrying some of the ""emotional load"" (we have a complicated life in general and both of us are definitely sometimes guilty of just letting the other partner handle stuff instead of attacking issues together), but I don't think that's the reason she's not interested in sex with me; I think she's just not interested in sex, period.  I've accepted the reality - I'm not happy about it, obviously, but I don't see it changing much: she wasn't particularly interested even when we first met (I thought we'd eventually ""grow into"" each other but it never happened).   But sleeping in the same bed doesn't automatically mean having sex (if it did, I'd be a lot more worried about her sleeping with my daughter!)  We'd been sleeping together without having sex for almost 20 years.   

It's interesting that you use the word ""stabilize"" here - I feel like our relationship is relatively stable.  There are many things I'd like to improve, but it's not clear how much room there is for that now.   I have tried asking her straight up, multiple times, why she is sleeping S.'s bedroom; she essentially deflects the discussion, or says it's because S. is afraid of the dark.",gu61tjx,gu5xsly

My wife and I actually spend a lot of time discussing parenting decisions.  I think we are more or less on the same page with respect to screen time; it's just been very hard to enforce (for both of us) because we both feel bad about cutting off her only social outlet.  I'd say we more or less agree on what the limits should be, but I'm more likely to just cut it off firmly (take away the phone, block the Internet, etc.) when time is up, trying to avoid getting into an argument about it, whereas they seem to have gotten into this pattern where S. wheedles, refuses to stop, complains, etc. and my wife, instead of just putting her foot down, gets angry at her, berates her for overstepping the bounds, but doesn't do the one thing that would actually halt the behavior (taking away/turning off), presumably because it seems too harsh. This leaves me looking like the bad guy if I do take action, and of course I don't want to always be the bad guy, so I tend to just give in as well, and the end result is that the limits get exceeded all the time.  My wife and I actually do discuss this and come up with plans to limit screen time regularly; it's putting them into practice that seems to be the hard part :-)",gu6ol8d,gu6bpkf

I think that your point about the effects of the pandemic is well taken.  It's easy for me to underestimate how traumatic it really has been, because as a family we've been extraordinarily privileged during this time (both able to work remotely, no financial worries, able to send S. to a private school that has in-person classes, etc.) and therefore somewhat insulated from the worst of it.  S. on the whole seems to be doing pretty well with the changes; she doesn't seem overly anxious, certainly is not having full-blown panic attacks or anything like that, but of course it's affecting her as it does everyone, and she may be having scary thoughts that are comforted by having M. there. 

I think that it might be helpful for me just to sit down with S. and try asking *her* explicitly how she's feeling about all the changes.  For a father and daughter S. and I are reasonably close - we share secrets, talk, spend time together, just the two of us, although perhaps not as much as before the pandemic, because the time we used to spend doing stuff (like working on projects) often goes to gaming now.  I haven't had the sense from her that she's feeling particularly traumatized.   I realize that she may be confiding in her mother in ways that she isn't in me, and that might be part and parcel of the whole sleeping-together thing, but it would be unexpected because my wife and I do discuss S. all the time (in the past when S. has had, for example, bad experiences at school, we both got involved) and I believe that if S. were anxious and confiding fears in her, M. would not keep them from me.  *But it's also possible that S. isn't confiding any specific fears, but is nonetheless displaying signs of anxiety at bedtime (she definitely protests if M. doesn't stay), and M. is picking up on that and staying with her for that reason.*  In fact, when I think about it this way, it might come down to M. simply not seeing any reason *not* to stay with S. (given that we wouldn't be doing anything but sleeping in our bed anyway) and therefore defaulting to staying with her if she seems anxious.  In other words, I might be making a mountain out of a molehill.  Still, I find it problematic that M. is evasive or at least non-communicative when I bring the subject up.

For what it's worth, I don't think M. and S. are scared of me.  We're a reasonably close-knit family in most regards, and fairly open with each other; we communicate freely about most things, and I don't think fear is a major factor in any of our interactions.   Compared to my wife, I do tend to get episodically angry (i.e. my frustration about something reaches a boiling point and then I rant and rave, but cool down pretty quickly, and such outbursts are rare) whereas she seems to let off steam by expressing continuous low-level anger much of the time, but neither of us is particularly prone to doing frightening things when we're mad; certainly there has never been any violence on anyone's part, or even the remotest hint thereof.",gu6gfpp,gu666i3

Actually, if this is the case, I'm OK with it.  Our marriage can stand the sacrifice, I'm sure.  But I do worry that for a 10-year-old it isn't exactly normal to be sleeping with Mom every night.  Both because it might engender anxiety when Mom isn't there, and also because sooner or later she's going to grow up and make the connection - if Mom wasn't sleeping with Dad, then Mom wasn't *sleeping with* Dad, and that means... In other words, we're not modeling an ideal husband/wife relationship for our daughter.  In general I'd prefer my kid to be blissfully unaware of her parents' sex life or lack thereof.

Some of the other commenters here seem to think it's not such a big problem, and honestly, I'd be happy to be persuaded of that.  I'm OK with letting it go on if there won't be any major effects on our daughter.",gu6mecd,gu68pns

We have shared a bed for 25 years and not had any real issues that whole time.  I mean, aside from the obvious, which is that we don't have any sexual relationship to speak of, but that has been true for nearly that entire time.  If my wife had wanted to sleep separately she could have started doing that a long time ago.  My impression is that she started staying with my daughter for longer and longer periods a couple of years ago because my daughter was needy and pressed her to stay after bedtime stories etc., and the whole thing built up into a habit that neither of them can stop now.",gu6jvch,gu6im4x

This is despite the fact that we don't really have trouble discussing other issues relating to parenting or other aspects of family life - it makes it particularly bizarre that she just doesn't have anything to say when I point out this obvious fact that she's sleeping in our daughter's bed and that isn't all that common.

I think part of the problem is that, because we're talking about the marital bed here, it *is* unavoidably tied up with the issues regarding our own intimacy; my wife has *never* been able to talk about that; back when I used to try, she would literally just go mute when I asked her about stuff like what made her feel good in bed, etc.  But in this case my concern isn't primarily about our own intimacy or lack thereof; I've already accepted that as a lost cause.  I'm not trying to get her to come back to the marital bed so we can have sex (we weren't doing that before);  I just worry about the effects the current arrangement could have on our daughter.

Or when he had too much to drink and snored horribly / or after an argument etc, you get the idea. 

I am 31F with my own family now and I honestly didn't care less at the time and in my case it didn't necessarily made me closer to my mom. It was just a sleeping arrangement which at times was annoying when I wanted my space.  Once I got older that space was easier to have when I had a pull out couch at 15 years old and most of the time I wouldn't pull it out so she would just watch TV next to me and then leave for the night.

That she’s trying to drink in and enjoy the last remnants of her baby being a kid while she can. 

Maybe the pandemic made her slow down and realize how precious your daughter is to her and to savor the time she has. (This has been the case for me, though I don’t stay all night and my kids are younger). 

As far as being damaging. Yes, I assume that it is. Kids repeat what they see. But, if you all have been living as friends/roommates for the last decade she’s certainly noticed that on some level as well and that’s also damaging. 

IMO you aren’t going to be able to fix the parenting issue unless you solve the relationship issue...Which may not have a happy ending. You’ve mentioned both things and your wife hasn’t been responsive. Would you be willing to risk divorce to get the relationship (marital and parental) that you think is normal or would you rather stay quiet and keep the status quo?",gu7it9u,gu6il3p

In my friends case I would say that it hasn’t harmed her daughter, but it has hindered her gaining any independence. However, my friend doesn’t acknowledge that. Her daughter is extremely anxious being alone now. One other thing about my friends situation that echos yours is the bickering and squabbling between Mom and daughter - they essentially bicker like a married couple. Also similar, Mom and Dad disagree about a lot of parenting tactics (he is too lenient and forces her into the “bad guy” role). They aren’t on the same page.

In reference to stabilizing your marriage - if you’re not on the same page as parents then there is some great room to improve here. This will hopefully create more stability in the parenting you do together, and have a positive impact on your daughter.",gu62lyr,gu61tjx

Hate to use this over-used term in today's world of parenting, but this could just be a 'phase'. Up until my daughter turned 10 and started going through 'the change', it wouldn't be unusual for her to jump into our bed a lot of nights as she always had issues with sleep anxiety. She was also very huggy/kissy until she began going through puberty. Now, she gets creeped out when either my wife or I even try to go into her bedroom, lol!

If you and your wife are not sharing any type of intimacy, this could be your wife's way of getting a different form of intimacy from someone else. 

Your post hits home with me in a few ways as my wife and I also suffer from issues with intimacy, among many other issues (see  my post  [Stuck between failing marriage and resentful teen daughter : Parenting (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/mop0u5/stuck_between_failing_marriage_and_resentful_teen/) ). we haven't experienced 'intimacy' per se for years, so, yes, stuck in one of those ""sexless"" marriages.",gu6ixor,gu61tjx

A few more ideas on communication: have you told her how you feel about the lack of communication, instead of just trying to communicate? That is, something like ""I need you to communicate with me about this. We're a team, and I need to better understand why you made this change. I feel like I'm being left in the dark and I'm hurt and confused."" Focus at first on just understanding and not debating or negotiating. 

You might also try communicating in writing if she shuts down with verbal communication. Written communication often feels less intense for people with anxiety, and it gives you space to manage your emotions before responding. 

You may need to insist on marriage counseling. I'm not sure how well that will go over. Books on marital communication might help you adjust your approach to be more effective, like the book Fighting for Your Marriage. Such books are most effective if couples work through them together but they might help you figure out how to approach things.

As to whether this might negatively affect your daughter. Maybe? If your wife is using her to fulfill her own emotional needs, that's not great long term and can cause issues. If your daughter needs the extra closeness right now for herself, it's probably ok if it really does stay short term. Have you spoken to your daughter about how she feels about it?

Even before the pandemic, S. used to get very anxious when her mother was away - she'd be fine all day, but get hysterical when it came time to go to bed.  And this was before M. started spending the entire night with her.  One thing I'm worried about is that M. has succeeded in assuaging that anxiety by sleeping with her, and for now (especially because the pandemic has ensured that no one is going anywhere), it's not a problem. Of course S. will soon be old enough to go away to sleepaway camp and the like and I worry that the anxiety will resurface, redoubled, at that point.   

It's really incredible to hear you describe your friend's situation - sounds like ours.  M. and S. bicker like a married couple -- that's exactly my feeling too.

One thing I would say is that I don't think my wife and I disagree all that much about parenting tactics (obviously, the sleeping arrangement is an exception!)  We mostly agree on where the limits should be (and on the rare occasions when we don't, we still decide mutually on where we are going to set them, and present a unified ""front"" -- S. knows she won't get a ""no"" from Mom and a ""yes"" from Dad, or vice versa).  It's more about the enforcement of the agreed-upon limits; I am more inclined just to put my foot down and take away the phone, or say ""eat what's on the table or go hungry,"" or similar whereas my wife will argue endlessly with S. about what she should be doing, but not enforce it.

The funny thing is she and I communicate pretty well, I'd say, in almost all areas.  Certainly with regard to parenting I'd say we are mostly on the same page, and we agree or can come to an agreement or compromise on most other aspects of married life.  She just shuts down any attempt at communication about intimacy, and I long ago realized it probably wasn't a good idea to press the issue.  That's precisely one of the worrisome things about this sleeping arrangement thing: she shuts down discussion about that as well.  That's atypical for parenting-related stuff; we don't have trouble talking about that.  I think the problem is that the question of sleeping arrangements necessarily intersects with the big white elephant of lack of physical intimacy (the one thing we cannot ever talk about), so even if I'm only trying to get her to talk about the effect it might have on our kid, she doesn't want to talk about it because she fears it might lead to a discussion of our (lack of a) sex life.

One thing I appreciate is my husband plays a lot of online games and has high behavior standards around it.  He is not toxic, doesn't scream at people.  Speaks up against toxic behavior when he is aware of it.  Manages his frustration appropriately.  So he's a good role model.

So at 8 it is really just this year that my kid is playing games online with friends - Roblox mostly.  A few kids were doing Roblox as young as 6 but it really wasn't a big thing until this year.  We wanted him to be able to identify inappropriate behavior (grooming, exploitation, etc.) and have enough self-control to manage his temper.  Enough self-control and ethics to refrain from bullying type behavior; BUT we wanted it early enough that there would not be peers engaging in toxic behavior and potentially expecting he do so as well.

We actually JUST instituted a yellow card/red card system because he was losing his temper in a game and yelling at a (real life) friend.  The expectation is you stay civil and calm even when frustrated, and if you can't do that then it is time to say goodbye and sign off.  So if I notice inappropriate behavior, yellow card and that's 1 warning.  If I hear it again, that's red card.  I warned him that if he gets red carded frequently, then I will know he is not mature enough to continue to have the privilege of playing Roblox and Facetiming friends.  He can only have that privilege if he is responsible enough to manage it appropriately, otherwise he is not ready and we would try again in future.

Another comment, the computer is in the TV room - no doing this stuff behind closed doors.  My husband and my kid both have gaming PCs and they are on a long desk in our TV room.  We don't let him do Roblox up on his tablet in his bedroom, etc.  Has to be where we can hear him.",hx26ydi,N/A

She is pretty good for her age and loves her piano teacher.

Is it better for us to just save the money or find some other hobby for her. She has been playing since she was 4 so I feel like a huge disappointment because we’ve invested so much time and money so far and she can read music now which I’m so proud of her.

Long answer: Just to normalize what you’re deadline with, few of my students actually like to practice — it’s a discipline and one that can take a while to really learn and feel at ease with. The trick, in my opinion, is finding the music that is so rewarding to learn that you forget you’re practicing. I was one of these kids and went on to get a college degree in music, so also, your child’s dedication can change over time. 

About her not wanting to perform: that too may change over time. Public performance is like public speaking — it’s hard!! There’s a reason you have to learn how to do it. Music doesn’t have to be performative, though it is expressive. If she liked to paint but didn’t do gallery shows, would you tell her to put down her brushes, or if she wrote poetry and didn’t share it with others, would you call it a waste of time? 

You say she likes her teacher, which goes a long way, in my opinion. If you haven’t already, I’d suggest sharing with her teacher what you’ve shared here — the teacher may have some creative ideas for how to help your child break through some of this totally normal reluctance to practice.

Your daughter has to find her own calling in life, and there's a pretty good chance that it's going to be something different from the one you might like her to have.

I grew up with a piano in the house and took lessons on and off. My interest in playing came and went; it was something I enjoyed sometimes but found boring other times. As it turned out, my main passion turned out to be computer programming, and that's what I went on to make a successful career out of (much easier to do than in the music industry BTW).

The thing about music and other skills is that you can pick them up again later in life. I'm in my early 40s now and have recently gotten back into it. Went all out and bought a really expensive hammond organ, taking lessons online from a very skilled teacher, and am practicing more than an hour a day. It's a great hobby and I really enjoy it. But I'm glad I ended up with a career in IT, because that's been a very reliable source of income and personal fulfillment, and music is a hobby that I can enjoy as and when I like.

Don't try to live your life via your children. If _you_ want to learn the piano because that's what _you_ feel passionate about, go right ahead and start taking lessons. But let your daughter discover her own path in life. Maybe she'll find (or already has) something else she's really into and good at, or maybe she'll come back to music later in life like me. Having said that, it's great that you've introduced her to music and given her the opportunity for lessons; there are many cool passions in life to follow and I'd suggest encouraging her to find other things that might turn out to become avenues for hobby or a career.",gvg7gem,N/A

My mother made me take piano lessons for about 4 years and she finally let me quit when I was ten but I still resent her to this day. I really did not enjoy my lessons and hated my teacher and I never practiced. My mother also let my older sister quit her piano lessons but sadistically made me continue for two years until I had like a nervous breakdown because she tried to lie about taking me to lessons one day and I cried hysterically when I realized she tricked me and had just driven me to practice as usual, so she went in and let me quit that day. But oh man.
Years later, I decided to take lessons on MY OWN for my pleasure in high school. My friend inspired me.

(I still have all of her compositions!) She stopped practicing and we stopped the lessons, but the seeds had already been planted. Learning piano teaches the fundamentals upon which all other forms of music are based. From there she went to playing percussion in middle school, singing in chorus in high school (she sang in the all state performance in 10th grade), then majored in music in college. She is currently an extremely successful music producer and DJ in San Diego, and we couldn’t be prouder. Bottom line—let your child make her own decisions. If she thinks she wants to switch to guitar, rent or buy a used one and let her try it. You might be surprised at what she can accomplish.",gvhvzm0,N/A

I was 12 at the time and I really wasn't wanting to practice or liking piano as much as I used to. As I got a little older I always wanted to go back, and I wish I had never quit. I still regret not sticking with it. My 16 year old daughter taught herself to play the piano over being stuck at home this last year, and we've recently acquired a stand up piano. I love watching her play, and am really proud she taught herself by watching you tube videos and teaching herself how to read music. She's going to start taking lessons from a teacher to learn more and I was thinking about trying it again myself. Encourage your daughter to practice, but maybe introduce her to some new music that shows how versatile the piano really can be when she is at an appropriate age. The band twenty-one pilots has amazing piano in their music, and my daughter has been really into learning their music. But she has practiced a lot of other types of music too. Even if she doesn't play right now or tries something else musical, it's just such a great gift to give to someone you love. Music has saved me and rescued me from some dark places in life, plus those kind of skills are great character builders. (Not to mention are impressive and will look good in a college application.) I just saw that you mentioned your daughter is going to try guitar. My 9 year old daughter is playing guitar and she really loves it. She gets frustrated really easily with it though so we've paced ourselves. We've broken quite a few strings while playing too, but she loves it. I just wanted to share my experience as that little girl who quit piano - I honestly wish my mom would have made me stick it out. But she was just being fair and letting me make my own choices, which i also appreciate. I hope your daughter makes some beautiful music in the future! Best of luck.",gvi1nct,N/A

Yes to asking her to teach YOU how to play a simple song!

Music making is a social and emotional activity - hence the enjoyment of the lessons. Practicing is not at a young age. Have to have a balance of both.

It's good you talked with her. It's not all wasted. She can read the music and play the paino at some level. If she continued lessons all that would happen is she'd get better at the piano. 

What if she practiced for another 10 years? She'd be better at playing the piano but would the time and money invested from now until then be worth it? Probably not. Could playing the piano become a lucrative career? Probably not.

It's a cool skill to have and she does have it. She can play good enough to impress most people, I'm guessing. That's good enough. It's time to move on.",gvgjjpa,N/A

Take her to the symphony! Look it up in your city. Many have kid-days where they can go on stage and talk to the musicians. No need to stay super quiet or dress up. Take her to outdoor jazz concerts and get her right up by the stage!

Once she's older, take her to the ballet or a Broadway show. Nothing excites people like seeing the talent applied.

I was already a very shy and reserved kid and making me play for people made me completely shut away from music, or any self expression through arts whatsoever.  Even now, I'm 27, and I have struggled very hard to undo not being able to show anyone my drawings or practise any music around another person, even my very supportive husband. 

    So, whatever you do, whether you encourage them to keep practising or find another hobby, respect their boundaries and try to understand that art, whether its music, drawing, or whatever else, doesn't only exist to be seen or listened to by others. It can exist for the artist him/herself to relax and de-stress with, to use as an outlet, to create and to enjoy. Art doesn't need other people to validate the benefits it gives us.

Edit: I'm on a phone and I don't know why the format is coming out the way it is.

I would like to mention also that not liking to practise around other people seems to be pretty common sometimes and if it's a shyness or some other problem, it can be worked through in a respectful and understanding environment.",gvjadcf,N/A

You could tie practicing to something else she enjoys, like if you practice 10 times without me nagging you, I’ll take you to your favorite park or whatever. 
Separately, you can have a set amount of daily/weekly roblox time i.e 30 min a day that isn’t near the time she needs to do things. Such as after school to decompress or after dinner, the majority of kids just don’t have the willpower or self control to choose something challenging or productive over electronics.

I also never liked performing solos. Always hated it. I loved playing piano to accompany others and I enjoyed solos with French horn in high school. My parents never made me perform and I am grateful for that.

Is she meeting her goals and improving? Is she being adequately challenged? Maybe ask her if she'd still be interested in continuing lessons if she had a different teacher. 

My daughter is highly social and when she was little we put her in soccer. She did well enough and didn't fall behind the team but it didn't take me long to figure out she was wanting to go purely for the social aspect. She was perfectly happy to warm the bench and chat. When playing she would never steal the ball for fear of hurting the other players feelings. Sweet but also 🤦. When pushed to become more competitive (by her coach not us) it didn't take her long to decide soccer wasn't for her. So we let her move on to her next interest which coincidentally enough was piano. When given a new piece to learn she'd practice diligently till she got it or she'd ask to quit. She never would really practice finger stretches or key arrangements that weren't directly part of a song. When she asked to quit I only required her to finish the course to recital then she could quit. 99% of the time she just wanted to quit because it got hard. But she did eventually tire of the class. She still loved her teacher but she had discovered art, animation, and drama and fell in love with it during a summer drama camp. So piano was dropped in favor of drama and art classes and so far (3+years) she has stuck with it. 

The important thing is to do your best to make it so they can learn as much about a given subject as they want. Don't press them to continue out of a selfish desire of what you want them to do. If they seem to have lost desire set a goal for them to reach and once said goal is achieved give them the freedom to choose if they want to continue. 

Your child's chance to learn a skill is never a wasted investment. You provided the opportunity and encouragement to learn something new even if it ultimately turned out to be something that did not fit them. That alone teaches them to not be afraid to try new things. That mom and dad are not going to discourage or bemoan ""wasted money."" By the way no matter how you phrase it saying you wasted money or time in their presence will devalue them. As in ""I am a waste of money/time."" It is also not a privilege you gifted but you being a good parent. Learning is not a privilege. Learning is something we all do daily just like breathing. It is on us as parents to do the best we can to give our children the best learning opportunities and strive to avoid them learning the wrong lesson. Such as ""we are too poor to do that for me."" That particular lesson sticks with a child well into adulthood. Much better to teach ""whatever I want to learn about is possible"" even if that learning is facilitated by unconventional means. (For example I learned bead work entirely through books and video guides and my daughter is learning animation through Skillshare) 

My advice is to sit and listen to your child. Ask them about their wants and desires. Ask what they may want to do in the future. Then listen to those answers and go from there. 

For my teenager she is currently set on the goal of majoring in drama so she can work on stage with a minor in counseling because she is also currently fascinated with the workings of the human mind and has always been a person that wants to help. My 7 year olds current ultimate goal is being a YouTuber and playing video games. A desire that is driving her to learn how to make videos, how to perform, how to read, and how to play video games better. That desire will likely change as she gets older and learns more about herself. (Prior to this she wanted to be a fashion designer) But that's ok because in this digital world it will never hurt to have a bit of knowledge on video production.",gvfzts6,gvfqx61

I enjoy playing stuff with my 7 year old. We have a lot of fun and he usually asks me to play stuff over asking anyone else. I’m fun dad!

I like playing things on the Xbox (minecraft). Things on the iPad (roblox, or various). I like sports (football, or general running around). I like arts & crafts, and drawing. We sometimes play Lego, which is good. We like doing an educational kit or something science-y and learning. We sometimes just watch stuff on telly. We do cooking or baking in the kitchen sometimes. We’ve occasionally done some coding on the raspberry pi. I don’t mind toy cars, or a train set. We used to play with his toy kitchen and he’d bring me bizarre combinations of play food and I’d enjoy “eating” it. Cups, ducks and squirty water things in the bath or sink are fine. Hide and seek in about 3 potential hiding places in the house is ok, but gets dull quickly. Board games, that’s another fun thing we do. I’m sure there are more.

Basically we have a fun time and have a variety of activities and toys that we play together.

But recently he wants to play (and I don’t know the best phrase) role playing/make believe. He wants us to be Jedi Masters, pirates or super heroes. And this is where I’m stuck. I understand the concept and I see kids playing this sort of thing together. But I can’t do it. 

When he was smaller he’d be a policeman and arrest me. Or a doctor and heal me. Or rescue me from a fire. But this, that he wants now, is much more in-depth.

He also, possibly due to autism, gets very angry when people don’t know exactly what he wants people to do. So, even if I try, it feels like a losing battle. It’s like he has a script in his head and is annoyed when people ad-lib, but he doesn’t understand that they haven’t seen the script and that it’s not fun for someone to dictate the exact sequence of things that are expected of them.

Possibly, due to (actual medical) anxiety, I always feel incredibly self-conscious. I realise he’s a child, but I still feel this way. Maybe, if we were the only ones in the house I might feel slightly better, but this is unlikely anytime soon. 

I really want to make him happy, but I can’t do it. Any advice?

My 5yr old daughter had her first sleepover at a friend's house last weekend, whose mom is my friend, and my friend had been telling me all the fun things she had planned for our little girls (nail painting, movies, baking a cake, etc). I was a little worried she would start to miss me, as she's only ever spent the night away at Grandma's, and Grandma spoils her with attention 24/7 lol so I wasn't sure how it would go at another family's house.

Well, of course they had a ball. Despite their age difference (my friend's daughter is 9), they have so much in common, they are both so inquisitive and precocious and love Minecraft and Roblox and Frozen, they really hit it off. They had a blast of course.

My friend (L) asks me to pick up my daughter at 5:00. Since I was already out doing groceries around 4, 4:15, I just went and got her at 4:30 (I texted L at 4 to let her know we were a half hour away). Not having seen my daughter in 24 hrs, I thought she'd be excited to see me again.

When I arrived and they said ""your mommy's here!"" my daughter (M) absolutely bursts into tears. Whining, crying, protesting. ""I don't wanna leave!"" She even ran away from me when I tried to get her to come upstairs with me to pack her little things back into her overnight bag. (L said, ""I tried to get her to pack up her things when you texted me, but she melted down, so I figured I'd let you deal with it."" Lol, fair.)

I take the cake icing spatula she is licking, and tell her she can finish licking it once her things are packed and she's ready to go (coat and shoes on.) That kinda worked but she kept crying. I was so embarrassed in front of my friend, and another one of our friends had popped over for a quick visit, so I'm like, ""great, my friends probably think I'm an absolute shit mother. The thought of going home with me is absolute torture to my daughter.""

She continued to cry the whole 15ish minute car ride home. I started thinking about when she was 1 or 2 at daycare, and I would come pick her up at the end of the day, she would yell ""Mommy!"" and absolutely run to me. I am tearing up thinking about it again. I think, ""where have I gone wrong, that she hates me so much now."" I text my husband that I am having a hard time dealing with her meltdown. My husband meets us in the garage, both of us in tears, albeit mine silently, and he lovingly takes her inside.

When I told him of the daycare comparison, he pointed out that that's different, because daycare isn't your friend's house. Of course your friend's house is more fun, and thus harder to leave. That made sense. I also allow that I had just started my period, and emotions were higher than usual.

Well, I think my daughter picked up on how sad it made me, that she was sad to come home. She is very perceptive and luckily for us, also really, really good with words for her age; always has been great at expressing herself. So that night she tells me that it made her sad to leave because she was having fun. I told her I understand.

Then last night she brought it up again. She said ""mommy,  I was sad to leave [my friend]'s house, because we were baking a cake, and it wasn't done yet.  I didn't get to have a piece. Can you tell her next time that I want to have a piece of cake?""

I had not even considered the cake as a factor.

They were baking a cake, and me coming a little early (I thought I was doing L a favor, bc I knew she had a Super Bowl party she was wanting to go to), meant that my daughter had to leave before seeing it done, or getting a piece. I feel like an idiot. I am putting myself in a 5yr old's shoes, and her entire meltdown makes a lot more sense now. Seriously, what is better than cake?! (Cake AND friends?! Come on.)

I realize now that I took it too personally, and I only hope that my friends didn't judge my daughter's meltdown to mean I am a terrible mom, lol.",N/A,N/A

I regularly have children go home in a screaming tantrum. It’s not because they don’t love or haven’t missed their parents. It’s not because they want to spend more time with me or even their friends. It’s usually because we just sat down to read a story, and they are now going to miss it. Or we had tidied up and I was about to put an episode of Paw Patrol on before they go home and now they are going to miss it. Or they finally got a turn with the toy they wanted and now it’s home time.

Kids go through phases, but they also grow up! I know it stings when you're in it, and it's okay to be upset, but think about it this way: this is just her spreading her wings a little, and her being so comfortable and safe away from you is actually a testament to your parenting! She knows she has a safe, loving home waiting for her when she's done hanging out with friends (unfortunately, that's usually much longer than you'd want).

You're your child's whole world for the first 3 or 4 years, and then suddenly their world expands, they find friends their age, and they become much more independent. They don't need you as much anymore, and playing with a friend is more fun than with the same adult you see every single day.

Secondly, considering your friend is also a mom I'm pretty sure she wasn't judging you at all. She knows first hand how this shit works, and almost certainly had her fair share. Who knows, she might have battled her own 3 foot demon that same night!

I love my son and we have an amazing relationship. He's 8 and still wants me to share in most everything in his life, and we have surprisingly deep and mature conversations sometimes. But, when one of his friends asks if he wants to come out and play, or they log onto Fortnite, you better believe I'm old news. It's ok, though. I want him to be his own independent little person. Sometimes I'm sad that he's so self-sufficient and I kinda dread the days when he's gonna be an apathetic teenager and I'm no longer ""cool"", lol.  It's ok to be sad about that. I will always get all mushy and weepy when I see old baby pics of him, no doubt.

That being said, try to not make your daughter feel guilty for having fun without you. I know, you didn't mean to and period hormones are a bitch, but as you said, kids are very perceptive and it's putting a huge amount of pressure on her if she has to always consider your feelings. If you keep acting bummed out about her not flying in your arms when you pick her up, she's not gonna wanna share with you how much fun she had because she's gonna feel bad for it. Tell her how much you missed her and how happy you are to see her. Then ask her about all the awesome things she did, and be excited for her.

He loves doing things and going places.  Every day when we picked him up from preschool and asked what he did, he would start with a pout, ""I was doing X and then I was going to do Y and Z, but Mommy/Daddy picked me up.""  When we drop him off he doesn't usually wait to say good bye.  Tantrums and avoidance for leaving a friend are pretty normally.  Here is what I get from this:

*He is a well attached child who has been well cared for in and out of the home his whole life.  He trusts adults to keep him safe.  He knows that mommy and daddy will always be there.  He has a safe base to be adventurous and explore.

*He is very interested in many things and has a great attitude toward new things which will take him far in life.  Also, we are good at setting up activities/people he enjoys.

*He is able to plan things in advance and anticipate what comes next.  This is a HUGE developmental skill that is correlated with all sorts of good things.

*He is good at building relationships with other kids and adults, which again is super important.  This also is set up by the base of us building relationships with him.

Overall, I think not wanting to leave when they are young is a combination of personality (my kid likes a lot of stimulation) and good parenting choices.  (That doesn't mean if your kid is clingy that you are parenting badly.  The personality factor is very important.  I'm just saying that given the child's natural inclination, parenting can push them too far in the direction they are lean toward naturally or it can center them.)

My 9 year old has recently been receiving grieve by her so called bF. When she comes out of school her friend is all over her like a rash and my 5 year old she's all Huggie Huggie with them both but likes to whisper alot around me and in school when I look behind to see where my kids are the girl looks at me shocked or guilty. Anyway for 3 months the little shit lied to my very sensitive daughter about her leaving the school whilst my daughter went on a residential trip for 5 days. My daughter wanted to buy her bff a gift and card I agreed but as soon as my girl mentioned it to her mate the date of the move kept changing from the first day of the trip to the last. Funnily enough the friend didn't seem to want a card to go with the gift because she didn't believe she would get it before she left despite it being given while in school. This friend kept stressing my daughter about when she was having this present and it caused her alot of anxiety. I got the gift and my daughter gave it on the last day before her trip only for the so called BFF to say oh I'm not leaving now it might be by the end of primary school year 5 or year 6 now! And the BFF said your gift isn't good enough! My daughter was heartbroken couldn't stop crying, blamed herself, and ended up having time off school because she couldn't stop crying and developed IBS type symptoms. I later learn this little shit has not only lied for 3 months but she's also been nasty to my daughter in school and then putting on a act Infront of me after school which is causing my daughter's confusion. This girl has also become a bit of stalker too she went through my daughters Roblox friends list and started friends requesting my older teen kids who don't know her or have ever seen her, when my other kids refused the friends requests the friend took her younger brothers tablets and friend requested my children again. The thing is my 9 year daughter is gutted because I've told her she can't have her has a friend anymore due to the ongoing lying, manipulation, unhealthy behaviour and toxic behaviour. This girl also told my daughter you can have all your other friends but if you do I won't be your friend! While this girl could talk to whoever she wants she isolated my girl and made her feel very frightened, confused and unsure of herself. I do not like labelling children but I generally believe rotten eggs like this one don't change and become very unstable abusive adults and it's something I don't want near my daughter, I just feel like the bad one because I've had to tell her to break the friendship off because it isn't normal behaviour.",N/A,N/A

Mom of 3 - 12, 10 and 6. Last year during distance learning we let the kids start playing Roblox so that they could interact with their friends. The younger two have remained pretty obsessed with it. As a general rule, they get 2ish hours of screentime to split between YouTube, Netflix, Roblox, etc., per day. But on Wednesdays and Sundays it's just one hour. In all honesty, the limit is my husband's idea. I let the timers slide when he's not around. I don't want them on screens all the time, but I know he and watched a lot more TV while we were growing up and I think he gets too worked up over it.
Our problem now is our 10 year old. She is supposed to charge her tablet in the kitchen overnight, but at least 4 times this summer has been caught sneaking it into her room to play Roblox and watch YouTube after we've gone to bed and brazenly lied about it when confronted. Last night she was up until 1am (from what I can tell based on app timers) and lied to my husband when he found the tablet hidden in her blankets. In the past we've taken away access to the tablet and Roblox as punishment, so she can only watch tv in the living room where we're always in and out. We've had endless conversations about trust, why she feels the need to sneak and lie. The answer is that we can trust her for sure next time and she sneaks because we're too strict. She is a very smart girl with a brain, attitude and vocabulary bigger than her years but emotionally she is very much 10 and I am at a loss on how to get through to her and stop this cycle.

As parents, you guys gotta parent as a team or you will be outsmarted & overrun. You letting the rules slide is openly undermining respect for your husband & not doing yourself any favors either. The “fun” parent isn’t respected, only liked in the moment of getting what they want. 

I’m not super IT savvy so I can’t directly help with that. But I can tell you that you need a hard punishment to get through to this particular kid (some of us just have to learn the hard way). A very long time without electronics. Maybe all devices need to be charged in your bedroom & explain in a family meeting that it’s because one person broke the rules (without directly naming). If the other kids know there will be consequences to rule bending, they will be less likely to help the one break the rules.

If the battery goes below 10% throughout the night, then she loses one hour or more. If it happens for 3-4 days consecutively then the tablet goes away for 2 whole days, for the whole family. 

Or you can keep the tablet with yourself after the bedtime. 

Expecting a preteen or a teen to maintain that conduct won't help, you will be disappointed. Hell I did it all the time. My parents just kept my phone and computer with them from 11 p.m. unless it was Friday and Saturday for a few weeks. It's normal. 

She is a kid, her impulses are strong. Morals and rules fade. People have a hard time controlling impulses till they are in their very late teens or twenties. It takes time. And she isn't breaking your trust deliberately to hurt you. It's that need for instant gratification. 

I know what wanting to stay awake throughout the night feels like. I haven't ever been in bed before 10:30-11 ever since I turned 9/10. And once I turned 11, I was reading fictions all night. And of course, the natural consequence was being miserable all day and not being able to work with that 2 hour nap after school in the afternoon didn't do much either.
It's something that kids, especially those with anxiety or those feeling like they don't get enough time to themselves do. It's called bedtime revenge procrastination. Or she could be going through sleep regression, kids from the ages of 10-24 go through that. 

I understand that 10 is too young, but by the time she turns 13, I guess staying up til late at night will be normal for her. It's alright. 

Does she get enough time alone with you, away from her siblings? On the tablet and with T.V.? Cause if it isn't sufficient for her needs, then I couldn't blame her. She is the middle child, that could be hard too. Maybe she feels that the night is her downtime where she can be alone and catch up.

The reason screen time is suggested to be limited for young children is because of its addictive qualities and its correlation to create almost ADHD-like behavior in children. 

Sneaking to bed with a book or a tablet I’d argue are equally unhealthy habits, and I also did the book as a kid. But it was definitely because I was never allowed free time to explore what I wanted during the day!! My parents hated when I read anything non-science and always nagged me to death about what I was doing, so the only option was to do it at 3am and ruin my sleep and my eyes. 

I think children who have other methods of entertainment will use them. But it’s the adult’s job to provide those better options so the child doesn’t feel like they have nothing better to do than Roblox, and on top of that have to lie about it.",h8jjrzr,h8iup11

Our entire mindset towards electronics is really fk’ed up. Replace tablet in your story with alcohol. Your child is sneaking away at night and lying to drink wine.

This behavior is LITERALLY an addiction, and it’s not comparable to your husband mindlessly watching TV unless he’s also addicted to the TV, cries when it’s taken away, and gets angry withdrawal without TV! 

And if you knew someone with alcohol addiction, would you keep wine out everywhere and be drinking it in front of them? Would you be serving dinner with wine, but the alcoholic gets just juice? No, cuz that would be cruel!! 

If you want to help your child develop good habits, you should consider a month or so break from electronics for everyone. Your child is 10 and can not magically grow self control out of the ground. So taking it from ONLY her, for an aspect of her personality she can’t even control (it’s not like she can work harder and get “better impulse control” like you can work harder to get good grades) is extremely unfair to her. 

You should be working with her existing personality, given to her from your genetics and your upbringing of her, and trying to help guide her to a successful place using good role modeling. Not punishing her for something she can’t control right now.",h8jkl5n,h8gv7x5

Hey all, 
My son, 11, plays as much Roblox multiplayer as he can. I'm a gamer and I'm happy for him to play some games but I hate Roblox because it feels very much designed to be addictive and get kids paying for Robux to buy stuff. I feel like the game has a negative impact on my son and I honestly think he'd be better off never playing it. However it's the only way he keeps in touch with a couple of his friends who don't live close any more, and he loves playing. At the moment we're trying to find a balance by using a screen time lock giving him 2h four days a week to play.

Does anyone have advice on balancing what you think is best for your child vs giving them some agency to make their own choices even if they aren't the best ones for them? I'd love to get to a point where he can self manage but right now if the screen didn't lock he'd play from morning to night.",N/A,N/A

My daughter is an only child and I'm a single mom with a full time job. Kiddo is diagnosed ADHD and takes medication for it. She had a Kindle Fire 10 Kids' Edition that I got her for the holidays last year. Roblox is what I see her play the most. I have my own account and will join her in games now and again. She's on it a lot when we are home, but has been going to a friends' house (three kids to play with there) as a summer camp over the summer and they do mostly playing outside and other non-electronic activities. School will be starting up soon for us, too. She does own two different skateboards, a bicycle, and a razor scooter that get used on days we are together when the weather is good, we go rollerskating once a week together at the local rink, and we do other outdoor activities like hikes/walks now and again too.

&#x200B;

I struggle with giving her something to do some days that's not her tablet. She isn't real interested in crafty stuff at home. She does have Kid's Messenger and chats with her friends (approved by me) here and there. I was hoping to give her new games to play by getting a Nintendo Switch for her birthday. It would be a ""one big gift"" thing as she really doesn't need anything else to collect dust in her room. Family members mean well and always want to buy her more LOL dolls (she has a ton at this point) or crafting kits (they just aren't getting used). 

&#x200B;

Would it be weird to ask for monetary donations towards a Switch? How do I justify it to nosey or judgemental family? Maybe I should outright buy the Switch for her. Just not sure what to honestly tell them ""what she wants for her birthday"" when they ask this year.",N/A,N/A

My son got a tablet when he was 3. My mom thought we were crazy for doing so and for some reason believed we'd just let him play on it for hours on end. He uses it during car rides to watch a movie or play an educational game or two, and doesn't even touch it when we are home by his own choice. During lockdown it came in handy for him to have his speech therapy sessions on and we used it a little bit more for educational games to help him learn letters and numbers and start putting together words, as well as read a long books. It has hundreds of books we read together on it to replace visiting the library. 

I think my mom really thought I was just going to hand him it and ignore him for hours on end, but really he wouldn't even adhere to that if I tried. He prefers playing with toys and always has.

Both of my pre-teens have iPhones. 

My 10-year-old, since she was six, after being diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. Having a phone within 20 feet at all times allows my husband and me to monitor and manage her blood glucose levels. My 12-year-old since he was 10. 

My daughter doesn't have any significant social media apps but is social in her gaming groups (Roblox and such) and texts with friends. We more or less caved on when to give my son his phone because his sister had one, and he has since become active in Snapchat and TikTok because both are extremely popular with his sports teammates as a group. 

I feel like we do a decent job monitoring their social media use and behavior, set appropriate limits, and are on top of having consistent discussions about what it means to be a responsible member of the digital community. 

Then something comes along that throws all of my parenting confidence under the bus and backs over it six or seven dozen times, killing it deader than dead. Like devious licks. 

I had no clue what a devious lick was until the end of the first month of school, well after the trend had hit the social media collective and reported in both our local community news and making the national rounds. 

How do we as parents stay on top of what is trending with adolescents? I asked my son why he hadn't mentioned the devious licks challenge if he knew about it, and his response was, of course, the irritating tagline of kids everywhere, ""I don't know."" 

I'm worried my question is rhetorical, but I need to put it out there nonetheless so I can maybe sleep a wink or two over the next few years:

How do I stay on top of what is trending with my kids on social media?",N/A,N/A

I think a little skepticism on media reporting of these kinds of trends is warranted. As a teen I remember walking in on my mom watching some tv news report on “lipstick parties” where girls were supposedly going down on boys while wearing different lipstick to create a rainbow effect? She looked at me in horror but also disbelief to ask if kids actually did this. Of course the answer was no (and I also disdainfully informed her that we all wore lip gloss and not lipstick anyway). Did someone somewhere do this once? Maybe. But thinking it through for one moment reveals all the many reasons it would make no sense. This one isn’t as absurd or upsetting but I do believe it is (consciously or not) being used by the media to drive uproar and therefore audience engagement. 

In my opinion, the way to stay on top of things is to monitor your own kid’s social media (which it sounds like you already do). Because a tiktok algorithm could pull them toward fun dances, or stupid challenges, or sports highlight clips, or violent misogyny and racism. Tiktok literally has the “for you page” that is designed to keep them hooked and coming back for more by adapting itself to their engagement with the app.",hjzaz5x,N/A

And that is why we disregarded the age requirement of 13 for her.  My 12-year-old is the one with the Snapchat account and his athletic teams all use them as a means of team communication. We did set it up as an ""everyone is doing it"" kind of aspect since it was so he would not be excluded. And I realize that may not have been the best reason. 

Ultimately, I am not concerned about the lying aspect and nothing either has done so far worries me. I feel that they are so far behaving and using social media respectfully. I am pulling a classic ""what if"" and worrying when there is as of yet nothing to worry about I suppose.",hjz5lsl,hjywoav

Good afternoon everyone, I am going to be as detailed with the situation so I can get the best possible feedback. My fiancé and I have been together for three years. He has a 11 year old daughter from a previous relationship. Him and I have a 1 year old together, I don’t have any kids from any previous relationships. When I first met him his daughter and him were super close, they would watch movies together, play board games, cook, go bike riding, and vacation across the world together. When his daughter found out I was pregnant she was super excited to by a big sister, her and I always had a good bond, but the bond began to fade because of the birth of my daughter who I have with her father and not to mention covid struck so the 11 year confined to her bedroom on roblox chatting with friends. The 11 year old is a part-time kid who has become very rude and super unappreciative when she visits. Her mother and my fiancé have a horrible relationship, they only talk through the courts. He has spent a large sum of money on custody agreements and child support when the little girl addressed her father saying she hates it at our home, she doesn’t want to be apart of this family, she wants to stay with her mother all the time, and she doesn’t care if she sees him again. Painful words for any parent to take in from their child, right? That conversation stemmed from her refusing to go to Disneyland, telling her father that she don’t want to go because she has to organize her school supplies :/ what child turns down Disneyland? Come to find out her mother had a plan trip that she wasn’t suppose to take because it was on his parenting time that he got approved from the court. This isn’t the first incident that something like this happened, the mother took the daughter out of town without the father and courts not knowing about it and told the daughter to lie to her father about her whereabouts. My fiancé had the find my friends locator on his daughter’s phone and saw she wasn’t in Illinois where we live. The agreement is they both have to have permission from the courts to cross state lines because the mother kidnapped their child at an early age. Very sad. Anywho, he hasn’t seen his daughter in over a month because she refuses to come over here and she doesn’t want to talk to him. So, I found out he has spent more money to resolve the issue which I was extremely upset because we have a child here full-time and we have a wedding next month and in my unselfish opinion I feel he should step back and let the daughter just be with her mother because she has vocalized her not wanting to be apart of our family. My fiancé also have been spending too much time with the courts and child reps to the point he neglects what’s in front of him. I am not saying forget his daughter but I don’t have any sympathy on his situation and he tells me I am unfair, I don’t see how. I been patient long enough and now it’s getting old and tiring.

The reality is that kids benefit from both parents, even of they are in different households, provided the parents are both stable. 

If he took money from a joint fund without talking to you, that is worthy of a conversation. But if in 10 years from now, you are the one that your child does not want to be with, would you give up? Probably not. 

IMHO it is absolutely worth his time and effort to be an active father to both children, regardless of how many hours a week he is with either.

I know it feels unbalanced, and it probably is unbalanced. I think the best think you can do is put the wedding on hold, and invest in couple’s counseling. Get clear on what your relationship needs to look like to satisfy both of you.

I know I wouldn't. I would chose my child over my wife. And I'm sure my wife would do the same. It's not that we don't love each other. The girl may be 11. But to him, it's his baby. He will always try to be with her and protect her and you shouldn't get in the way of that. 

Regarding him spending money and you being upset. Of I was in his shoes. I would reconsider the marriage and postpone for as long as is necessary to resolve the issue with the daughter. Are you mad because he is spending money on trying to keep his family together instead of spending it on you? Why can't you pay for the wedding? If he is earning the bulk of the money. Then he should be able manage it without having to worry about his wife hating him because his daughter is.. let's face it. More important. 

Sorry if I offended you in anyway. I'm just honestly giving my opinion and o do see your point. I just feel that you should give him more space and support him more.

You mentioned he spends more time trying to get her back than he does with your new child but what do you expect?  At least you’re there for him, his other daughter is being pulled away and he needs to fight for their relationship.

You mentioned that he’s not paying the mortgage. Is he asking you to cover his portion while trying to fight for his daughter or is he not paying it and not telling you?

Sadly I have zero advice for that. As for the financial component of trying to get his daughter to see him my opinion is kind of useless without knowing the numbers involved.  All I can say is that I’m happily married with two kids but if something ever happened between my wife and I and she pulled this shit I would go to fucking WAR with her over it, you can’t blame him if you’re missing a vacation or two so he can see her,  you can definitely blame him if your house is about to be put into foreclosure over it. At some point you need to cut your losses but you have to understand that him walking away now means having no relationship with his daughter possibly ever.

Unfortunately I’ve seen a lot of step parenting situations like this. They’re in it for the spouse and don’t feel like they have a parental responsibility to the kid. In fact, one of my close friends is in the process of marrying a man with a kid who she ‘only tolerates because she loves fiance’.

Mario Kart 8

Animal crossing (Perfect for creative kids)

I was gone 5 years very long story not by my own choice. At first my 6 year old was over excited to see me weekly for dinner and staying 2 nights every other weekend. We always go have fun swimming, park, hiking, etc. Total we have been visiting for 4 months. 2 months ago she started to not want to visit for dinner, whatever. Then she started to not want to stay 2 nights. Now I have not had her over to visit for 1 month. My daughter was raised to believe she was living with her dad and that I didn't even exists. I kept hundred of pictures of us together to show her and it was going perfect. I video called for 2.5 years until I was ignored too much. I feel like since I have eased up on visiting that she has found out she doesn't have to visit. I feel like we connect and she messages me on messenger drawing of us together and draws I love you and dad is written in her pictures, we play roblox together,  and color/draw. She's definitely a more difficult type of child emotion wise and instead of giving answers will only say I dont know. She has fun here and used to dislike having to go back home to mom. Any suggestions or any thoughts on how to handle this? I dont want her to keep deciding not to visit me for months when our relationship the first 2 months was amazing, she wouldn't even leave me alone. She didn't even say hi to me when I dropped my son off today, but I also know she's a stronger silent type.

Yes it means one of the days someone has to solo parent, but turn it into a movie and pizza day or something. Make it a 'holiday' for the kids, because they are probably over it too and if they are having fun, its going to be easier for the solo parent too.

We're all losing our shit. We work all day, eat dinner and hang out with the kids for a bit, do the bedtime routine, and then go back to work to try to finish the stuff we couldn't get done because of the 9000 distractions during the day, so it feels like it never stops. I've got the ADHD, and I have been coping well for years, but I desperately need the structure of the office. I cannot function like this, and I've started taking medication that I had left over from 2013. When it runs out, I'm fucked, because getting a script for it again is going to be a nightmare. 

My poor kids are being raised by Frozen and Sesame Street. We are literally just throwing screens at them to get through the day. This has to be terrible for their development. I loved having them in daycare. They were learning so much and I was always excited to see them. For a while they were right next to my office and my daughter and I would get lunch all the time. 

My husband and I are coping (sort of) by giving each other tiny breaks. We take turns watching the kids for a bit while the other one goes and sits somewhere quietly for a few minutes. If you're the one who gets up with the kids on the weekend, it's understood that you get a nap or a couple of hours of alone time later in the day. My husband usually gets up with them on Saturday and I do Sunday. We also split the kids between us a lot, which makes them more manageable. It's also how we do the things we want to do. My husband will take my older child and get her to hang out while he plays guitar. I'll take the little one out to the tiny backyard while I garden.

My mom is his caregiver, and the look of pure confusion on her face when I said I wanted a day -maybe 2- to just be able to drop him off and go back home and sit in the absolute silence. Clean? Maybe. Lay in bed and nap? Read? Scroll mindlessly? Maybe go get my toes done or a haircut? Maybe take a nap without being half conscious listening for the kiddo to wake up?

I can’t handle regular basic crap anymore (like feeding them every second). I’ve given up a lot of the stuff I used to do for everyone. It’s just too much. Kids now get their own breakfast and snacks. Dad or I will do lunch or dinner. At first I felt like I needed to control everything and that wasn’t working. The kids are 9,7,4 and have ideas and thoughts beyond what I think. Lol.

BUT what I did realize is I have some anxiety in parenting. I used the youper app that helps you track how you are feeling. I tend to have good days when I have time by myself even if just an hour to run to the grocery store, AND when I get to spend time and do something with ONE kid. Like going on a bike ride with one kid. Making dinner with one kid. Going to take the dog for a walk with one kid. Being home with one kid while dad takes the other two out. I think it’s the complaining and requests and bickering when everyone is together that is my anxiety trigger.

Maybe try taking one kid somewhere with you or splitting up the kids so you can focus on the one.

No matter how much hubby tries to help when he gets home it’s only so much because there’s dinner to fix and a house to clean. We are lucky enough to have a child who sleeps 7-7 so we each get some time in the evening to spend together or relaxing with a book/video game/etc.  I agree that when you can you should try to get out alone.

My kid has stayed in his in-home daycare since the beginning of all of this. He is a 2 year old. His sitter doesn't take him anywhere, but she does go shopping when she has to for groceries. 

My husband & I both work in hospitals & been around all sorts of patients. So far (THANK YOU JESUS!!!) we haven't gotten sick or anything. Plus, I am pregnant. Due in 3 weeks.

I think if your parents or in-laws been practicing good social distancing, cleaning & etc.. Your kids would be fine with them so you can have a break. 

&#x200B;

Of course this is my opinion & if you don't feel comfortable, then maybe either get up before them or stay up later to have 'alone time'. My alone time is everything at 8:30 PM. My son goes down at that time so I stay up till 10:30, give or take to relax, rewind & etc.

I agree that you need a day! I might steal your hotel room idea because I did the same thing when I had a “half day” and being away from the house would honestly let me relax.,funt7j3,fumidnt

We’re both still working, and our relationship is still working, and we have much to be thankful for. But the grind these days is a lot, even though we only have a 1yo and she is sweet and relatively easy. Our jobs have actually become more demanding on us for various reasons so we are working full time gigs on half-time hours with no room for slack. Then cooking, cleaning, shopping, maintaining the house, trying to raise our child, staying connected to friends/family, staying engaged with this exciting moment of change in our society (we’re in the US)... there’s so little time to just sit down and do nothing, let alone something we want to do.

And we’ve talked a lot about the Grandparent Option. We feel similarly that there’s just something about the risk that we would have a hard time forgiving ourselves for. Yes, we’ve been quarantining for 3 months, but we still go out for necessities. What if we’re infected but asymptomatic? What if our parents are? We don’t live in a place where asymptomatic people can get tested yet, so there’s just no way to know. I know people who have made different decisions and I don’t judge that, but for now we’re basically doing the same thing you are. Maybe circumstances will change our minds but now we’re hearing news about a second wave of infections percolating so we’re sticking with the program for the time being.

Couple things -

Limit screen time. My kiddo is autistic so we have it tied to a reward point system - we were struggling with him viewing video games as a right not a privilege, so this helped both limit screen time and teach him he can't just fill his day with a game. 

Screen time is actually OK if it's productive - learning doesn't count as ""screen time"" for us (coding games, math games, online comic makers, etc), nor does his virtual Minecraft social group. My kiddo is autistic so this social learning group is a real boon.

Last thing. Here's a hot take I wish more people understood. *It is good to be bored.* being bored is a skill, it teaches us how to live with our fucking thoughts, be creative, gives us an opportunity to daydream. Shower thoughts? They happen because we are UNOCCUPIED. Being bored is a skill that needs to be developed. When my kid comes to me and says he's bored, I give him three things he can do, if he doesn't want to do any of them, I tell him to practice being bored.

 Idk a out anyone else but my parents were busy and poor and I was always bored. And yet, our impulse as parents is to give our child something to do. Did being bored as a kid damage me? No. I'm fine. (also, I'm not talking about NEGLECT. don't neglect ur kids please. But a healthy boredom is fine.) if anyone feels like they need permission here you go: it's OK to let your kid be bored.",h0rssjo,N/A

I played so many video games for so long as a kid, and I've done just fine as an adult. I haven't played Roblox, but Minecraft is fantastic for learning all kinds of things. My 5 year old plays it all the time, and we use it to teach her about planning, architecture, animal care, and a whole lot more. And she's built some really cool things! 

We also play Rayman together, and she's learned about team work and incremental improvement, which has helped tremendously as she's started learning to read. When she gets frustrated, we just say ""Remember how you thought you'd never beat that one level? Then you practiced it over and over and then you got good enough to beat it?"" And she immediately perks up and starts trying again. 

If you don't like the games he plays, help him find options you're ok with! Games like Planet Zoo are fantastic at teaching about everything from how to care for animals to budgeting to design.",h0rkws1,N/A

""Just cut screen time"" is a... rather stupid response. You have an 8 year old, and you expect him to entertain himself for hours, alone. Of course he goes for the interactive option. 

It would be a videogame issue if he was picking screens over playing with you or with other kids. That would be a reason to limit screen time.

But telling an 8 year old kid to entertain himself, then taking away the one mildly entertaining thing there is?

Either put in the effort to play with him or to get him to places with other children, or let him play games.

Eight year old kids are not supposed to play alone. It's a critical development point and it should be one with friends or at least parents.

""Regular independent play"" is simply being told to be alone without interactions. Third graders need interaction, be it from the parents, or with friends.

Telling a third grader to constantly entertain himself with zero interaction is not healthy, it's not natural, and it's not good parenting.

Hello everyone,

First time poster in this subreddit. I am a mom of one almost 16F and one 9M. We have a blended family, and went through one very abusive (emotional, then physical - as soon as it turned physical I left and cops were called) relationship prior to my current (my only other previous relationship after leaving their dad.) Daughter is not his biological, as I had her when I was 16.

We have definitely been through the ups and the downs together. Currently though, we recently moved in with my current boyfriend, all seems to be going well on that front. I made sure to do regular check ins with my daughter especially before the move to make sure this was something she was alright with doing. It definitely increased our quality of life, etc.

Recently we switched the kids to being with their dad an extra weekend out of the month as he didn't want to increase his support from $80 a month to $100/month. I have them the rest of the time, full time. She went on a tyrade today through snapchat because she doesn't get to go to Calgary with myself and my boyfriend (we are doing some recon for a family trip we have planned later in the year hopefully.) But the thing is, she doesn't want to go because of the Covid situation either.

Which brought up how she needs life to slow down, she can't deal with all of this, she's depressed, she hurt herself, she can hardly get out of bed in the mornings, etc.

From what I have seen, I have seen her sleep in, get out of bed and go straight to playing roblox and being on the computer with her friends, I have driven her to see long distance friends a few times to do fun things like go to the lake, etc. etc.

I ask her to do the dishes as chores and keep it relatively tidy since both me and my boyfriend work full time. Me and my boyfriend made Thursdays game nights with the kids to try and do fun things together, we've taken them on day trips out on the water, to the beach, etc.

I just today accepted a new position with more pay for less time (yay me) so I can spend more time with them getting off earlier and not having to work weekends.

I'm just - defeated as a mother right now. It seems this always comes up every month or so, and it's always the day after they back from their dads. I'm not the type to bash the other parent, so I have let her think I am the reason we split up ultimately due to a bad decision on my part.

She has been out of school for roughly two years (on and off due to the pandemic where schools shut down.) So I don't know how much of this is due to the pandemic, etc.

Does anyone know how I can help her? Any advice at all? I just want her to get back to a place that is happy.

TL:DR; Daughter is complaining about not having a good life essentially, not being happy, complaining constantly and I believe I am doing everything within my power to help her but it's like it's never enough.",N/A,N/A

I bet it could help her a lot with processing divorce/blended family stuff. It’s possible she knows more than you realize that something was off in your marriage to your ex, because teenagers pick up on that stuff. So that would be a good thing for a therapist to help her talk through. And with covid on top of everything, it’s probably just making life feel a lot harder than it normally would.

I know this will sound vague but I think the biggest thing is just showing you’re there for her and available to talk - ie, if she needs emotional support she can “pull you off the shelf” and seek your help, and then put you “back on the shelf” when she feels better and wants to go back to being an independent teenager who ignores her parents, and back and forth - I think with most teens they go through both of those phases a lot. They want freedom but they also want to know that you are right there if they need something.

Maybe spend solo time with each kid occasionally, so they have an opportunity to talk with you about any unexpected feelings about all the family changes.",h97o7d1,N/A

Definitely worse, but that's how I started around the age of 14 or so. Depression, by its proper definition didn't settle in till I was 16 and even then, there was so much to keep me occupied that I couldn't really bother. I hit a breaking point when I turned 17. I never ever told my parents what your kid told you, not because they weren't helpful but because they couldn't understand. They are still the best and supported me when I sought a psychologist, got on anti depressants, and ADHD medication (yeah, I got diagnosed with that too and was non functional in a way). I can't even imagine how bad I would have been during the pandemic. 

But if your kid even opened up s little, I'd take that as a win. Don't nag her a lot, she will just shut down. She has opened a very small window in her world for your to see, and if you invade her personal safe space too much, then she will shut it right at you. If you take the privilege with compassion and understanding, slowly by slowly, she might start to open up more. 
Take her out for walks, drives, etc. so that she isn't forced to make eye contact and can divert her focus if a certain topic makes her uncomfortable.  And then talk, ask her about her day, about how is she finding school, what's going on with her friends, ask her about the LGBTQ community (make it general, don't put the focus on her), share your childhood experiences and try to listen. Just validate her. Don't put your opinions forward for the time being, not the ones that contradict hers. 

If she is having trouble with studying and motivation, tuitions might be a good idea. The burnout that she might be experiencing could definitely be a reason too, it is for a lot of kids. Tell her that if she is having problems then she can take extra tuitions and you would like her to. Not to get good marks but to keep up with a little consistency. And there are things that we sometimes cannot bring ourselves to do at times, outside help is not unwelcome. 

Enroll her in activities. If she is not getting that outlet to let her energy out, then it's trapped inside of her and when that happens for more than a couple of months, your body starts to shut down, so does your brian because how can they continue to make more energy and make your more miserable? Running, lacrosse, basketball, soccer, tennis, table tennis, gymnastics, badminton, shooting, horse riding, is there anything that might appeal to her? It is extremely important for children of all ages to be in some sort of physical activity all the time. If none of these, then can gym help? 

Arts and crafts are a wonderful idea too. Dancing, singing, band, etc. can be helpful too. Again, kids need activities regardless. 

If there is no motivation and will to do anything, then volunteering may be a good idea. Take her to shelters, animal shelters are the best. The adorable dogs and cats and birds give you this hit of dopamine that makes you feel incredibly at ease and happy. 

Don't spring this on her. Don't make decisions for her. When kids hit puberty (10-11), they need input in their lives. They need to make choices, they need autonomy and independence and freedom. Ask for her input. Which shelter would she like to go to? She likes animals, wouldn't she like to spend some time there? What time suits her? Mornings? Evenings? Weekdays? Weekends? And then listen. Don't say ""but I think..."" Ask if she would like to take some time and sort her schedule out? 

Activities, volunteering, sports, they help in building confidence and raise self esteem in a child. A sense of purpose, to do better, to feel like they have something to look forward to because they like it. It does wonders for ones social life as well. She will feel more comfortable once she meets kids her age. 

It's sad that she couldn't experience it from a young age, but it's not too late now. 

Don't pressurize her. Take her for drives and walks at least 4 times a week. Take her for shopping sprees, for little lunch dates, for a manicure, to museums, to galleries, to the mall, to the movies. Make those non negotiable. She needs to spend time with her mother and grow comfortable around her. She needs to feel like she isn't alone. 

Don't bug her about college now. She is under too much stress, let her catch up first, get in a healthy and happy state. If she wants to take a drop year and develop some skills by working or travelling, let her. If she wants to be at home, let her be. As parents, we can't just leave our children high and dry the minutes they turn 18. They are still emotionally immature at times, impulsive, and make the wrong decisions. It's not a wrong thing for us to support them till they graduate or have started to make a proper living for themselves.

She experienced abuse as well. Might not have been directed at her but she did see it and feel it. She too, is a victim of abuse. Treat her as such. They are fragile, they need patience, empathy, understanding and love. That emotional turmoil is hurting her and as she grows up, all that happened in her life is now catching up to her. She needs space to figure it out, accept it, learn to handle it and then move forward. That may take a few years or so. Let her be. 

Too much went in her life and she had no idea or even an opportunity to control the events around and in her life to make it bearable. That helplessness leads to frustration. 

I read in a comment that you couldn't take her out because there was no one to watch her younger brother, I apologise but I have to ask, does that mean that she didn't have much of a social life or that it had to be put on hold because she was made to babysit? Or that she didn't have enough space to deal with puberty, relationship troubles, hormones, sexuality, etc. because she had a child attached to her 24/7? Or that she was left alone for long periods of time with a 7 year old? Cause if that is the case, then she must have been parentified (you can read up on it). And that is a form of abuse too. That takes a lot of toll on ones mental, physical, emotional and psychological health. 

If that was the case, then I believe that proper apologies and amendments are in order. No matter what the situation was, she shouldn't have been made to do all that. She doesn't need reasons as to why you did what you did, she already knows. This is not the time to defend yourself. She needs apologies without excuses and reasons to justify yourself. She missed out on too much. I don't know what any kid in her situation would do except to shut down. No outlet, instead of prioritising herself and her emotional well being (which is the most important thing, the rest comes later), she had to put herself lower than all. That is not at all a healthy way for any teenage girl to grow. 

 Accept your part in all this. And help her heal better. She needs support. You have that, your son has that, but who does she have that will only be there for her? Who wouldn't make her do things for the care of someone else, even if that her own brother? Who would be there for her only? 

I know how hard this is for you but if she put everything on hold, let her life get out of her control, and spiralled down because of the circumstances in her life which she didn't get to play a part in, I suggest that it's time that you do the same. Not saying to harm your mental health or anything but she missed out on a lot and that harmed her. So it's fair that we compensate for it by doing the things that should have been done a long time back. 

And if this isn't the case, then I apologise for assuming.

I have always tried to let her know that I am available any time of day, in any capacity, whether in person or through text to talk out her feelings with her. I've had a hard time for the last 2 years as a single mom working in sales (sometimes 12.5 hour shifts) coming up with enough time to do anything with them, and when I was a single mom (I had no support from my mother really) I had no one to watch the boy so I could take her out on her own to have like a girls' day just the two of us.

(This happens BTW, so don’t find “another thing” to beat yourself up about). 

Though you’re ex isn’t helping things, I would not focus on him as the prime cause as it sounds like a multiplicity of things.  Certainly, your daughter will benefit most from having someone to talk to, neither you nor your ex-husband: a “therapist.”

Throwaway account because I feel just awful complaining about my daughter. She’s 7 years old, we are like best friends, we do everything together. 

However... since we are entering into almost 1 year of lockdown and the kids barely being in school means she is always here.. always. I am a student and can’t work because I need to be home with her, tbf it’s the best job in the world anyway. But I hid in the bathroom for 15 minutes just to get peace from her talking shite about her Roblox outfits.

Everything I do or say, she questions it like she’s Alberta fucking Einstein. Today we were baking, I help her obviously but she was doing a good job so I just gave little tips for her to use to make it easier and so she wouldn’t waste the fondant, she ignored them all, obviously. Next thing I know she looks like a fucking smurf. I lost my cool more than usual because I’m just so stressed out at her for not listening to me.

Hello, my son will be turning 11 in June and has ADHD to put things in perspective.  He has been talking to groups of people on Roblox game and found out he’s been talking in a chat group called discord.  I told him I would be monitoring his chat on discord since chats can be inappropriate.  He says he has been talking to a girl that he says is “12” for the last 4 months.  He says she likes him and wants to be his girlfriend and was asking if he can be her boyfriend.  We didn’t think much of it and thought it wouldn’t hurt and it would only be an online thing.  She lives in Canada and we are in USA. I’ve been paying closer attention to his chats and I tell him that I do check.  I’ve noticed she has some sort of mental illness.  She has been saying her ex sends pictures of himself cutting himself to her and she skips school and is currently going to therapy.  She said she will be going to USA to visit my son and my son keeps telling her to come to USA.  They started saying I love you etc.  I told my son that he shouldn’t be telling her to come to usa as they may never meet.  I also told him that you should tell her just to be virtual friends and not a boyfriend and just to blame me saying I would ban him from discord if he didn’t.  It was getting pretty obsessive in their chats and that’s all he would think about especially with hyper focus/obsession ADHD.  The chats from him have been “don’t hate me” etc.  After he told her he couldn’t be her boyfriend, she has been saying she is no longer eating and that her body is starting to shut down.   My son always tells her not to hurt herself and that he loves her etc and she loves him as well from the chats.   I’m writing this as we are on vacation and not sure what to do.  We regret telling him that he can have a girlfriend as we didn’t think it would escalate to this.  We also didn’t know she had some mental issues.  We are not sure how to proceed from here.  Not sure if I should keep confronting him on his chats and for him to distance from her more, or to ban discord.  This is new to us and I don’t want him stressing out over a girl that has mental issues.  Advise would be appreciated and hope this is the right  group for this kind of post.  TIA.",N/A,N/A

Try to remind him that you and he are not responsible for that girl's actions no matter what and that it is probably best for her to not be in a relationship at this time too even if she doesnt think so.

Get him off that site. As soon as you can. It's toxic, a shit site, most people are lying anyways, don't trust the girl that she's actually 12 or whatever, don't let your kid talk to people online unless it's genuinely not going to have any negative effect (ie, stick it in your kids brain as much as you can to not release any personal info and then type on like miencraft chats about the game only).

People have bad intentions. it's how it is. And you can't count on them to protect your son from things he shouldn't be seeing. There's a lot of sex talk on Discord, drug use, rape discussions, just in general things he shouldn't be seeing till he's much much older.

Plus Discord is 13+, so he shouldn't be on it to begin with for that reason if not from a safety perspective. 

She screams either attention seeking girl or 40 year old man, either one isn't something you want but most CERTAINLY not the latter. She is manipulating your son, clearly a manipulation tactic. I see it as clear as fucking day, and your son does not need to be exposed to this shit. 

So please, get your son off Discord. It's not safe. Especially for a little boy. Ban Discord. Please.",gsao5cu,N/A

It’s been about 1.5 weeks since we stopped him from talking to “her”.  We educated him how unhealthy it is to talk to her right now and that she may not even be a 12 year old girl and that he is only allowed to talk to people he knows.  We basically told him he couldn’t talk to her.  He has been asking to play fornite for two years and all his class friends play it.  We had that in our back pocket and used it as a transition and to keep his mind busy.  He was sort of upset for 2-3 days but hasn’t mentioned anything about her.  We didn’t block Roblox but he so into playing fornite with his class buddies that he hasn’t even logged in that game where she was playing.  I also blocked most third party chatting software in our house to prevent any temptations.  Thank you all that gave constructive and non judgmental advise.,gtis0vg,N/A

Remember, the virtual worlds our children are engaged in are amazing!! And, they are also social outlets. If, when you were a child, you had access to an amazing fantasy world that you and your friends could play in, wouldn’t you be there all the time? 

In our house, we do a few things. 

First, we have daily chores. So, it doesn’t matter if you would prefer to be in your virtual world in your room. You have to come out and do your chores. 

Second, we try to create opportunities to do some things that are cool and fun and competitive!!  We have one kid who really likes sports. And, she will leave her room to go play softball any day. We have another kid who likes to go outside, as long as somebody’s outside with him.

Third, we encourage some of the non-gaming behavior. We found out that two of our kids like to go on walks around the neighborhood and talk to each other. So, we adopted it, made it kind of a rule. Hey guys, it’s time to go on your walk. And, they do",h2dw7z2,N/A

My rule is she has to get dressed, brush hair and teeth, help with her chores, read a few books, do some math/writing and play outside at least a hour everyday. Once those things are done she can have screen time. I’d say typically she gets about 2 hours a day of iPad/tv time since summer break started(usually broken up not all at once). When she’s in school it’s closer to 30 mins because she’s so busy with friends, activities and school work. 

I have a 2 year old also and he does about 30 mins of tv time total(no tablet) but he’s not really into it yet. He rather play with some cars or blocks.",h2fg7b5,N/A

And no screens during meal time. If it's nice outside we have him take his break by laying in the hammock and reading or drawing pictures or even taking a quick nap.

So my 8 year old has always been different, but in a good way. He is on the spectrum of aspergers and knows what he likes. Still plays with Thomas the Tank, loves sponge Bob and when he gets chance still enjoys watching Peppa Pig. He tends to hide this though as I he knows it is for younger kids.

Throughout his life he has had long hair, we cut it short once but he wanted to grow it back. He also likes having his nails painted if mummy does, again we let him do it as we don't agree with the blue and pink boys and girls thing.

Most recently he has asked for his ears pierced, I spoke with him and said when you are older and we will have to think about it, more trying to just see if this was a phase request and one that will pass over time. 

When speaking to him I mentioned the pain as he is very sensitive and gets upset over any pain or smallest of cut or bruise. He was adamant he would be ok, I also explained to him my concern was the other kids who may pick on him for having it done because we all know what kids an be like.

He came out with ""I don't care if they call me a girl, I know I am a boy but on the inside I feel like a girl anyway so I don't care what they say as its my body""

This was the most adult thing he has ever said!

Obviously I love him with all my heart and will support him no matter what as I feel this feeling is his decision and not something influenced by the Internet etc as he does not really go online other than Roblox.

Has anyone else experienced this or going through this with their child?

I don't want to encourage it, however I want to support it as much as possible. I want to do whats right without him growing up either thinking I was to forceful with it, or not supportive enough if that makes sense.",N/A,N/A

I recently read something about people on the spectrum being more likely to Identify as non-binary or transgender because neurodivergent folks are more likely to not conform to social norms anyway. I honestly wouldn’t worry about it. I also don’t believe it’s necessary to establish a gender identity at such a young age. Sounds like he knows who he is and your job as the parent is to be supportive, especially since the world can be a cruel place.

At first, I popped in to see what others might have to say. I've worked with children for a long time and yet to have any of my own. So, I've only really seen this sort of thing from an educator's/nanny's perspective.  


What I can say is that I've seen a side where the child was supported, whether it was a ''phase' or not. I'm starting to feel these days that it sometimes could be one or the other, but one cannot really know for certain until they go through it with the child.  


But I feel that regardless of if it's a phase or a blooming self-aware identity, you are on the right track of being as supportive as a parent can be. As long as you are avoiding shaming or degrading tone/actions, I feel that he will benefit the most.  


As I don't have children, I tend to talk to a LOT of people. When it comes to people that have gone through such an experience I ask questions and really try to listen.   


As far as towing this line of support from you, from what I've learned, the best you can do and really all he can use positively is just that. Support. We all know there is no handbook or status quo. But for the most part, we get an idea if we really think about ''What if we were in their position?'' So, when he comes to you to vent, to ask a question or get feedback, or if he just wants to REALLY show off his excitement of a new style he is investing time in, remember to see HIM and to love him. I feel this is the best guide. For he's being true to himself and it sounds like he's on a way of really knowing who he is. This is only really nurtured through love, patience, and support.  


I'm sure one day he may ask detailed questions as to why he is different from his parents, the other children, ect. Or perhaps he won't. But he'll remember that you were in his corner the whole time, no matter what. Keep doing what you instinctively, TRUELY know what is right. I'm sure it won't steer you wrong, even if sometimes it seems uncertain.  


Best of luck!",gxzyj86,N/A

The only thing I would add is that without pressuring him one way or another you can still make sure he is exposed to positive representations of trans and non-binary identities, to make sure he is aware that they exist and are options for him.

Your boy sounds like he's very in tune with how he feels.  Since he already feels shame about playing with younger toys like Thomas and stuff, sounds like you need to trend carefully. He's already aware of the social norms, and he's probably aware of how he may be sitting outside of them.  Maybe just chat with him about that, age appropriately, of course.  Re-enforce how he can like whatever he likes without feeling shame or weird about it. As long as he loves it, and isn't hurting anyone, then it doesn't matter what others think.  Other than that, it sounds like you've got the right idea. Love and support him.  My son also recently told his mom about his thoughts that he may be trans. He's 15, also on the spectrum, but has never really shown any signs of feeling like/acting ""like a girl"" or anything before.  He hasn't said anything to me yet because apparently he's nervous to talk to me about it. It's clear my opinion/approval means a lot to him and just the thought of rejection may be holding him back.  I only plan to tell him how much love him, always have, always will, no matter what. I just want him to be safe and happy.  I'm going to ask him to try his best to truly do some self examination and think about his influences, as he spends a lot of time online and hangs out with some of the other trans kids at school.

Hello! My aunt died a few weeks ago and she left us with her 7-year old son (my cousin). My uncle can't spend too much time with my cousin (his son) because he's busy with his business and he's also grieving my aunt's death. A week ago, my grandmother (my uncle's mother) also died so my uncle is a bit of an emotional wreck. But he does try to spend quality time with my cousin every now and then. 

My cousin has alternative caregivers. One is a relative of ours but sometimes, she's busy with household chores, she can't give her full attention to my cousin. The other caregiver is my other aunt who's my uncle's sister. She occasionally plays with my cousin but because she's working from home, she can't give her 100% attention to my cousin. 

Oftentimes, my cousin would videocall me or his cousins in his mom's side. Whenever I'm not doing household chores or not working from home, I'd give him my full attention. He's very clingy and whenever I visit their house and I have to go home afterwards, he'd block my way and doesn't want me to go home. 

I know he misses his mom so much and he knows his mom is never coming back. The pandemic made it even worse for kids like him since he can't be with his playmates of his age. I'm 31, he's 7. Most of the time, I'd just watch him play Roblox or Minecraft. Sometimes we'd watch YouTube videos together.

Can you guys suggest other meaningful activities that we can bond over other than YouTube or computer games? He's coming over to our house sometime this week and to be honest, I don't know what activities can be done together with him. We can just stick with the usual Roblox, Minecraft, or YouTube but I know how short a kid's attention span can be. 

Thanks in advance. 😁",N/A,N/A

They really bonded this year when he would video call her during the hours I was working from home. He takes her around (on his iPad) and stands her up and then he... does things. He plays lego, or on the swings, or whatever! They ""talk"" for hours at a time.

She doesn't just watch though. She often pretends to be an announcer when he's being physical ""This is it ladies and gentleman! X is trying to jump from the couch to the chair! Can he do it? Will he SURVIVE!??"" And he eats it up. If he's doing lego, she might ask what he's building and then look up facts about something he mentions. She'll shower him with info about megalodon while he's building one from lego. She sings him songs, or gives him suggestions of songs to ask Alexa to play - then watches him dance party. She buys two of some coloring books and she'll color ""with"" him on the same page, then they compare.

In the end, for my son, it is about having someone care what he's doing and give him that undivided attention. She doesn't pepper him with questions. She participates in HIS play. She becomes a part of HIS world. And for a kiddo who spends most of his time in someone ELSES world - that is absolutely huge for him.

She has a falling out with friends over RoBlox “I want to kill myself”. She gets caught sneaking candy and lying about it, then cries and says she wishes she’d choked and died when we issue gentle consequences like no dessert the next day or something. Today I caught her sneaking on her electronics when she was supposed to be reading for homeschool. I told her that we need to find a way to stop the sneaking and lying, and consequences are all I can think of. So, no electronics for a few days. After that she cries as if her dog died and again threatened to harm herself. She says it’s not because of the punishment but because she doesn’t think she can stop lying. 

I feel like a prisoner. If I don’t let her do whatever she wants, I get this terrifying threat. 
She sees a counselor and we’ve worked on this. She started an antidepressant about a month or two ago after consulting with her counselor and her pediatrician. I’m overwhelmed and don’t know what to do.  I don’t think her counseling sessions have helped at all.  I’m open to any thoughts, shared struggles or recommendations.",N/A,N/A

She threatened to harm herself at school one day and I had to bring her to a crisis center where they sent her three hours away to a Psychiatric facility for 16 days. It was One of the hardest times of my life. When she finally got home she was A LOT better. One thing she came to realize and told us was she didn’t truly want to harm or kill herself. That her emotions were so strong in the moment she felt that way but wouldn’t have done it but that because her emotions were so strong she didn’t know how to express it any other way. Maybe your daughter is seriously and in that case maybe some in patient therapy would be a good idea. Sit down and talk with her, ask her if she truly means it , and if she does that in patient therapy is something you’re going to consider. Like my daughter , maybe she just has really strong emotions and that’s how she expresses them. So talk to her about how to express them in a different way ?!

I think my daughter has some addictive behaviors attached to electronics. We loosened a lot of screen time rules because we felt so badly for the kids during Covid. At least the can FaceTime or play online games with friends to keep those relationships going. But, I think she’s become WAY too attached to her phone and laptop (both issued due to need for Covid homeschool to allow her to contact me at any time when I have to work and to do actual school work).  Just writing this makes me realize that a lot of parent decisions this year have been based on guilt due to the shit Covid world we’ve been in for 12 months. 

I also feel like she’s a passive participant with counseling, and I don’t know what to do there either. We changed from one therapist who just kept getting me to buy her things she wanted and talked more about herself than my kid. The second counselor I think is great, but my daughter shuts down with her. Maybe because she is more straight forward and doesn’t go for BS (which is why I like her).  

Then again, this counselor told me that she doesn’t “care for consequences”. I get it. Negative reinforcement isn’t supported in a lot of parenting literature, but the way I see it, adults go to jail for stealing. Isn’t it better to give safe and educational consequences now, to spare the kid very real and potential life-ruining consequences later in life? What’s the alternative?

This is how we respond when someone wants to hurt themselves. DO NOT THINK KIDS CAN'T BE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. Kids her age can and do hurt themselves and commit suicide. This should not be treated lightly. And she needs to know how serious these words are and to only use them when serious.

My daughters therapist was a really nice lady who knew that she was really shy. But she stuck it out for a few months and she told me that if she didn’t want to continue that it was fine. 

She did recommend one book for me to read: get out of my life but first can you drive me and Cheryl to the mall by Anthony e wolf.

You have to find the right consequence. 

A consequence so god damn scary that it will shook her core , a consequence that is logical with how she act and a consequence that she can have control over with if she play ball.

What do you do to an adult that threat to do harm to themself and cannot control their impulsivity ?

Jail ? Nah...Throw them on the street ? Nah.....

You institutionalize them for their own good. 

If your kid cannot control her lying and threat to hurt herself and there is nothing you can do about it , you let it in the hand of professional.

Now , i am not recommending you put your daughter in an instituation.

I am merely suggesting the fact that she might really fear this consequence if she know thats its where it will go if she continue to act like she act.

Fake a couple of phone calls where she can hear you , let a couple of pamplets around the house. 

She use threat and manipulation to get what she want out of you guys by controlling your fear.

I merely suggest you reflect back at your daughter her own strategy. 

Lets see just how much she dont care about consequences.

This sound harsh but i was harsher on my son.

At 6 years old , he pull off the i want to kill myself because something trivial happened in school. ( he learn that shit from Minecraft Donny video online where the girl always act like a manipulative bitch to get what she want.)

Without skipping a beat i took a 8 inch kitchen knife and put in on the table infront of him and told him : If you ever say shit like this....you better be ready to do it for real.

He never threatened us again with self-harm and as bonus , he stopped watching minecraft donny video by himself. ( he have a sense of preservation where he will stop behavior that will lead to him getting hurt or scared ) 

My son is scared of the dark , he is scared a meteorite will wipe out the earth , he is scared of loosing his dad and mom.

He dont want to die , he dont like to hurt himself and have low tolerance for pain.

I aggroed hard on him because i know he was bluffing and bluffing about hurting yourself will not fly in my house.

You should really not be listening to me , your daughter life is to important to gamble upon what stranger are saying on the internet but i want to share with you how i deal with such scenarios.

Some children will only understand tough love , sometimes you will only have the choice with your child about being the one delivering a bit a control trauma or let nature do her course until karma hit. 

I never punish my son , never remove something from him , never have to fight with him. 

All i do is reflecting back the shit that he try to send our way until it come back to hit him in the face. Only then he learn. Only then he accept his fate as his mistake. 

Action - Consequences , every time , all the time. 

Good luck and if you give up to fear , nobody will blame you. Gambling with a kids life is not for the faint of heart and require a direct understanding of who the child really is and what they are capable to do or not to do. 

I think she need to be afraid of something , something more than herself. 

She need to be afraid of where her action is going to led her. 

And only you and you wife can offer her a glimpse of what it might be. 

Good luck,",gr1waht,gr18tg8

Hi,

Simple purchase advice please!   My 8yo daughter needs some tech, she has a really old IPad which doesn't run many of the latest games & apps.  She also borrows my laptop quite a bit, which is really annoying.   Time she got an upgrade.   But, I can't decide whether to get her a new IPad or a decent laptop.    Happy to spend some cash for reasonable kit but would like it to last a few years at least.

Current advantages & disadvantages, in my opinion :

Ipad :   really portable, great for the car, dead easy to use, plays Roblox / Minecraft & lots of freebie games, watches movies & Disney Plus.   School apps & google classroom really easy.  family have Apple so facetime just works.  My worry with a new one, is it will only last a couple of years before she needs a laptop anyway for secondary school, and it's not really offering anything new.

Laptop :  Currently plays Minecraft java, various Steam games on mine. Better for school work & learning, generally better as it teaches tech & could have fun configuring it when she's a bit older.   On the downside it's more fiddly of course, I seem to be forever pissing about with notifications & settings & odd issues. Its also less portable (yes I know it's a laptop but its bigger than an Ipad and she's only little.  Equally concerned that in 2-3yrs it will just be out of date and she'll need a new one anyway.  Also for even reasonable gaming needs a good spec.    

Other considerations - desktop best IMO for gaming but she needs the portability.  Not interested in Chromebook, seems like a sad version in between the two.

Really stuck to decide..... any thoughts from you wonderful redditor parents?",N/A,N/A

I have a Mac and an iPad and I choose to use the iPad more. Plus you can get her an Apple Pencil and she will be able to run more programs with that. Also you can get a keyboard with it.

Growing up I feel like all I did was play outside. We had lots of woods and a huge yard. Our house wasn’t winning any awards, but we had room to explore as kids. My best friend lived across the street so we spent lots of time playing between our two homes. 

But as a parent, I secretly loathe playing outside with my 6 and 4 year old. Many times they don’t play well together. And they’re miserable until I find a way to entertain them. Even then they find a way to hurt each other or cry. Like I’m supposed to be some kind of clown. They’re too little to run off and we don’t have any neighbors their age or woods to for them to explore. 

All I want them to do is put their video games down, yet if we go outside it’s an equally miserable experience. Maybe we’re just bored since we’ve been playing in the yard day in and day out since quarantine started. Anyone else get anxiety about this?

Edit: thanks for all of your suggestions. After typing this out, I’ve realized a couple of things:

1. One of my kids needs no help with their imagination and is self sufficient outdoors. The other only will come outside unless I entertain him in some fashion. If I don’t, he just mopes around and says he’d rather be inside watching TV or playing Roblox (each of which we try to limit/balance as best we can). 

2. I’m not a clown. 

3. I need a fence or a neighborhood with sidewalks. Those sound fun.

4. There are as many times I really enjoy it, it’s just not always, and doubly so when I can tell they don’t want to be outside. Makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong, even if I’m not.",N/A,N/A

I'm honestly burnt the hell out on entertaining my kids. The older 2 (6 and 9) have days where they just fight no matter what we do and it can be very unenjoyable to be around them. It's hot as hell outside right now so unless we can get to the neighborhood pool, almost all outdoor activities suck. I also have a 1 1/2 year old so that limits the activities we can do as well. I enjoy going on walks with them when the weather is nice and going anywhere they can just run around and explore without having to worry about traffic.

It's not your job to entertain your children. I'd recommend checking out busytoddler on Instagram for some tips, ideas and activities.

 Do you have a child safe yard that you can dump them in and leave them that has things they can play with?

There are 3 your olds who are bilingual out there, on top of knowing sign language. Kids are only as smart as you encourage them to be. My mom encouraged responsibility and creativity while my dad encouraged working with my hands as well as learning techy things (he's a computer and software engineer).

My mother would take us to the nurseries to pick out pots and garden statues (my favorite were tiny detailed oriental buildings) that we would spend weeks outside decorating creatively with different painting styles she taught us (not kid styles) and then got to take care of plants in them that we started from seeds in little glass jars placed in our closets. You can also sand matches down (so they don't play with fire) and teach them to stack them. Make it a contest if you want. Or build things with popsicle sticks if they're not too inclined to eat glue. Arts and crafts are capable of keeping kids busy at most ages. If it's too hot outside, put up a canopy to work under and fill an inflatable pool (if you don't have an actual pool) and let the kids take swimming breaks when their focus is drifting. You can even give them water squirters. They may even take naps from the exhaustion so that's a major win. 

If you know how to hype things up you can always get them to be interested in things. My mom would hype up chores as if it was awesome and fun and ""big girl stuff"" so I always wanted to do them with her because they made me feel helpful and proud of myself, and it meant I got to do ""big girl stuff with mommy"". You can even bake with them and try to do funky things like multicolored pancakes. I was doing my laundry and cooking before I was even 10 and as much as I know it was a form of manipulation on her end, I'm happy that's how my mom raised me because I got to spend real time with her and learn valuable skills in taking care of my home and new family. I plan to do the same with my kids because sticking a phone/tablet in their hands to ""keep them out of my hair"" is not parenting, yet I see other people doing it constantly and it makes me so sad. 

Again, kids are only as smart as you encourage them to be.",g24dwll,g23pjy1

Couldn’t sleep so I thought I’d find help and found this Reddit community. Thank you for reading this and taking the time to respond. 

About one month ago I found out that my daughter (13 years of age) was struggling with depression and we have since found her mental help by connecting her with a therapist. Just last night my son (7 years of age) started crying and said he felt he was going to die. When he started crying my heart just fell to my stomach and I felt as though I had failed now twice as a parent. My true understanding of what I believe my son was trying to say was he was sad, bored, and struggling with life. 

My sons routine is usually go to school remotely(on Zoom) until about 11pm; take a break; finish homework at around 2pm; play Roblox and watch YouTube until dinner time ; play Roblox and watch YouTube and go to sleep. Normally when he is playing Roblox he is on FaceTime with his closest cousin and they play/talk a lot. However, he has not been as available recently throughout the week, and only more so on weekends. 

I of course will jump in and play Roblox or watch a show with my son at least once every other day for about 2 hours. Also I make it a point everyday during dinner to talk as a family and ask everyone how their day was. My wife too will jump in and play Roblox with him for about two hours. That is the normal routine.

Perhaps this has been my down fall and not giving my kids enough of my time. 

During the pandemic our routine has changed dramatically, my wife and I, in efforts to keep us safe have remained in doors. We may have taken it to the extreme and only really gone out for food until recently. The kids almost always stay at home while I go get the food. Perhaps this has been my biggest mistake by isolating the kids too much? I’ve since tried changing our ways and starting getting out for walks, or taking the kids to drive around the neighborhood. For example, today we walked to Target and purchased some treats and new version of Uno. We played that after dinner for about an hour. This does not seem to have fixed anything, but I’m going to continue trying to go outside.

This post is getting long, so I’ll get to the questions:
- Am I a total idiot by letting my son watch YouTube and play Roblox all day without restrictions?
- Do I just need to man up and spend the entire afternoon with my kids?
- Do you think this is large in part to the isolation of the pandemic? Or perhaps the scare of being unsafe because of the pandemic?

Any advice is welcome and I appreciate your honestly, thank you. I’m just so very hurt by this and want to be a better father.",N/A,N/A

I definitely don’t recommend so much screen time for kids his age. There are real world, physically/mentally stimulating ways to show him how to entertain himself with his imagination or to play together. 

• Reading together

• listening to music and having a dance-off

• creating something together like paper planes with a penny to affect pitch

• Each if you draws a picture, and you pass them to each other to color however you want.

• Make a big loose scribble and have him decide what it looks like. He then takes a thick marker and outlines the thing he sees in the scribble and colors it.

• You can take turns drawing and the other person guesses what it is.

• Make a boat with a rubber band and pieces of wooden popsicle stick to twist in it to propel the boat forward in the bath and have a boat race

• You can make a cardboard fort and draw furniture around in it, or make a blanket fort and tape paper cutout furniture in it

• Write a story together sentence by sentence (each of you switching back and forth so it’s written together and can lead anywhere)!

• Maybe play “Lava” in the living room, or find more board or card games to play.

You definitely want to get his body moving every day which will release Endorphins, the “feel good” hormones. If he tuckers himself out each day, he’ll sleep better and it can help reduce his funk.

I totally support his gaming, especially since it includes socializing, but being stationary in front of a screen for so long can breed depression and can lead to him losing sight of how to help himself feel better when gaming doesn’t always  “fix” the funk when he’s older.",goppgbi,N/A

This hole situation has been hard for everyone.

I was trying to do the responsible thing and basically shut us off from the world and covid, but I noticed my toddler became more restless so try taking them out more on the weekends when you know certain places will be more empty. For example I take my daughter out to the park around 11am, donut shops around 10am, certain stores when I know they’ll be empty. Your kids are also older so they’re able to wear a mask so that’s great, opens up a bunch of things to do. We also do a lot of hiking, arts and crafts. I think this absolutely has to do with being isolated during a pandemic and not being in school. It’s easy for us adults to adjust because we understand that there is a pandemic but we really just uprooted our kids lives, school stopped, socializing stopped basically the normal stopped.

He needs to develop skills to deal with boredom and frustration and big feelings, and screen time is a crutch that you are letting him overuse. It’s helping him set aside/ignore feelings instead of being inside his own head and dealing with them, and then at the end of the day the feelings are still there and he hasn’t had a chance to process them.

I get it, parenting in a pandemic is parenting on hard mode for sure, but you’ve gotta detox that screen addiction  and teach your son some healthier coping strategies or you are setting him up for long term misery.

Your daughter will likely continue to play these games, whether you want her to or not. The only thing that will change if you forbid ones with open chat is that she will get better at hiding those ones from you. Video games are a socialization tool for modern kids, especially now in the age of COVID. This is where her friends are -
 which may or may not be the same ones she has at school - and this is how they hang out. 

The absolute best thing you can do with her is to teach her proper netiquette. Help her learn how to spot threats and predators. Explain to her what information is OK to share (what music she likes, what her hobbies are, etc,) and what information is not OK to share (her age, where she lives, what school she goes to, her e-mail address or social media, etc.). Make sure she knows how to use the block and report functions of any game she is playing. Make sure she knows not to send or accept any files that someone sends her.

And - and this is the important step that I think far too many parents skip, because of how uncomfortable it can be to talk about - explain why. Explain how there are scammers out there who want to mine her for information so they can potentially get access to her - or your - accounts and financial information or get a virus onto her machine. Explain how there are predators out there who want to hurt her or coax her into sending them pictures of her naked. Give her the grim details, because it will help contextualize why the rules that you're setting exist. 

Kids generally understand rules if you explain out the reasons behind them and will react better to those than blanket bans.",gkeho92,N/A

My father in law had a heart attack while we were having lunch together at  in-laws house.  He just closed his eyes and fade in his chair. 

The older kid (11 years boy) said he closed his brother eyes so he can’t see, the little one (9 years boy) doesn’t rememberers what he saw. We take them to other room while trying to figure what what’s happening, talking to the doctor and carry FIL to the car to take him to the Hopsital. 
Everything happens very fast. 

My kids seem fine now, we talk about how he is with God now, in peace, that he died happy, enjoying her favorite food with the people he loved. 

The little one cried for moments, also played some games and asked a lot of questions. The older just close clenched his hands into a fists and contained the tears. A few hours latter he told me that the image of FIL fading in to his chair was on his mind all the time so he wanted to play Roblox to distract from everything.

When I was twelve my family thought it was a good idea to bring me to the hospital to see my grandfather who was dying of colon cancer one last time.

I'm not sure if it was planned. But he died holding my hands. It was a horrible moment and I never forget it. I think he came off his medication but it's obvious his mind is gone even though his eyes were wide opened. He started to stare in horror at the ceiling and failing his arms around trying to fight off something. My aunts told me it was the agents of death coming for him (SEA Culture) and asked me to comfort him by saying it's ok to let go and his family is all there for him. (grandma, his daughters and sons and I'm the only grandchild allowed because I'm the oldest) even though it horrifies me and pains me to see him in distressed, I repeated what my aunt said and luckily he calmed down, moments later he was gone. 

I only had the occasional dreams about him leading up to and a week after the funeral. I think it helped that my relatives reassures me with tales of the after life and how he's at peace now. I've always been very spiritual as a kid so perhaps those stories calm my mind enough so I never had nightmares about it. 

Your 11yo sounds like he's mature enough to handle death and don't worry about him traumatized. Kids are a lot more resilient than you think. Just talk more and encourage him to open up if he feels overwhelmed.",g8mcm05,g8lgnfg

My son is almost 7 and I see big differences in him compared to other children (I know you shouldn’t compare). He’s a funny, happy and brilliant boy. However he has always had a speech delay and has been to speech therapy but discharged, and even though he talks none stop, he can be difficult to understand which is causing problems in school as he can’t seem to communicate how he is feeling properly. We are also trying to have him assessed which I feel he shows traits of dyspraxia and possibly adhd. He just seems to have slipped through everything even though I’ve been trying to get help since he was 18 months old. 

Anyway our biggest thing is his fixation on characters. At 3 years old he was obsessed with the big bad wolf to the point he would pretend to be the wolf, we’d read the story all the time and at Halloween I bought him a dress up wolf costume and tail to which he wore the tail every day for about a year! At 4 it was PJ Masks however he only loved the villain Romeo and was actually so good at mimicking the voice. At 5 it turned to Scooby Doo villains and monsters where he would draw and talk about them to the point he wouldn’t think about anything else. Lockdown happened, schools closed, I had his baby sister and he learned how to work the PlayStation, mainly minecraft, he started watched YouTube and gamer videos like FG TeeV and was then introduced to Roblox, Piggy and all the other characters like Bendy, Cuphead, Hello Neighbour etc it then went to sirenhead and cartoon cat, then sonic.exe and now it’s Lemon Demon from Friday Night Funkin. He is so obsessed with this character he is not doing his schoolwork which he really struggles with anyway, he is constantly drawing him and cutting him out. The teachers think he is scared of the characters and don’t feel it’s all age appropriate which don’t feel he is scared of but do agree with the age appropriate issue but it’s so difficult. I don’t want to be the parent who is like “sorry son, you like that too much so you cant see, play or talk about it ever again”. The thing is I don’t feel it’s any different from what other kids his age or in his class are into. He’s just not interested in good guys or superhero’s, he just loves the villains and always has but sometimes it feels like he can’t tell the difference between reality and fiction. He drew a picture of his baby sisters 1st birthday and Lemon Demon also attended. The way he handles the characters and fixates on them is different from other kids. In school if he has a temper he then starts acting like the character which is usually a demon or monster then will come back again and say “oh what happened there, I just turned into a demon” he knows fine well but he uses it as an excuse when he’s out of line or has temper.

He also struggles with letters and numbers and behind with most aspects in class. However the teachers have also said he’s very imaginative and the best drawer in his class.

I will also add he is such a loving boy, constantly tells you he loves you, is amazing to his baby sister and tells her he’s so proud when she learns to do something. He’s never showed any jealousy towards her and will sit and play with her and keep her out of any harm like putting things in her mouth or falling over.

Has anyone else had this experience, when he fixates he barely talks about anything else, it the same questions over and over and looks like he struggles to see what’s real and what’s not.",N/A,N/A

- He’s probably feeling powerless, isolated, unable to relate to his peers, and possibly “stupid” because he’s behind in class. Pretending to be a villain may make him feel powerful. I think he probably needs therapy to learn to express his emotions in a healthier way. 

- You need to have him evaluated for learning disorders, ADHD, autism, the works. The solution for a kid who’s still struggling with letters and numbers at 6 is not to stick him in class and hope for the best, no matter what the school district says.  Push hard on this one to get him help, even if you have to pay for it privately. 

- You can absolutely restrict access to things he likes that aren’t good for him. You wouldn’t let him eat unlimited candy after all.  You can cut him off from YouTube and the PlayStation and whatever else is contributing to these obsessions if that’s what you think is best.",gyycogr,N/A

It was like it was halloween all year round! He also loved the scooby doo scaries, he also had a speech delay and talked a mile a minute, he also is very sweet, sensitive kid (&smart!). 

I wont get into diagnostic stuff here. But I will say that there are different ways to be intelligent. And I think it's common for kids (esp boys, but also girls) to be into the scary stuff. Likely hardwired into our primordial brains that some people feel the need to explore the things that scare them -  (think how popular the true crime/ serial killer genres are for adults). The world is especially scary when you are a kid & considering how vulnerable kids were historically - makes sense that they would explore those fears as a form of play & imagination. 

For instance, my same nephew is also very ""analytical"" thinking. When he was 3, he was TERRIFIED of the vacuum.  I went over one day he goes ""tum tum (come come)"" He took my hand and walked me to the vacuum. He gibberished a mile a minute - but I decoded that he was explaining how it sucks up the dirt in the hose, and the dirt spins around in the middle and it makes a loud noise. I praised him for his discovery and he had pure joy on his face that I understood what he was talking about.  I was frankly very impressed that he broke it down so logically & rationalized his fear.      

Anyways, I wouldn't ban any of those things he is interested in if it isn't causing any harm & it is just imaginative. Best of luck!",gyyryqx,N/A

He might be on the autism spectrum, just from your descriptions of him 'obsessing', his temper (he may be having meltdowns), the speech delay, and the struggle with numbers/letters. I'm autistic, and definitely saw a LOT of things in him that I did when I was young.

  
 IMO, I wouldn't restrict any of what he enjoys, but instead use it as an opportunity. (i.e. you said he struggles with letters but he's imaginative- the two of you could write a story based on the characters and help him with his letters at the same time etc.)",ha4s76f,N/A

He has also been assessed before and after the 1 hour appointment was told he didn’t show the typical traits of autism, was too well behaved for adhd although it would possibly be around age 7 when it would be easier to diagnose. Speech therapy have had him on the waiting list since December last year for assessment again and after speaking to them again he is still far down the waiting list, I just feel he shows traits of many things, it’s really the fixation on characters, I actually think even if he didn’t have access to YouTube or the PlayStation he would still find a way to fixate the same as with the Scooby Doo villains however he has always liked the bad guys even from a young age. I don’t even know how to explain it, the things he’s into he hears from his friends in school aswell and I guess age wise I would say about 8 and not 6, it’s the way he interprets things compared to his peers. Your right though and I know this myself, I won’t know until he is reassessed for everything. I was just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.

That’s the way my son was aswell. He hated the vacuum and would just run away from it, it’s calmed down now though. Last year we got him the Scooby Doo encyclopaedia which showed every character so his teacher could understand who he was talking about 🙈

His attention to detail is scarily accurate and he’s very imaginative and has always been good at building and creating things from Lego and toys. However in school  he gets really upset if someone touches something he’s built. The teachers have said he likes to leave the class to basically stash them and keep them safe. His head teacher has a few in her office too lol. He notices the smallest details in pictures and he’s very good at drawing, today they said he was the best in his class. However it’s his communication and he struggles with letter, numbers and basically any reading and writing. 

He can speak now and likewise doesn’t stop but it’s the way he says his sentences and if he’s excited to tell you something he gets mixed up but he’s also the first to tell you “no you don’t understand what I say” and he does say I instead of “I’m saying”. Most of it is shortened down. 

Only time will tell, I have made jokes that when he learns to read and write he’ll probably create horror movies or stories. 

In the meantime I will push for any assessments again, he just seems to have slipped through, he’s worked hard to get where he is but even the school have said there may be something there but we can’t pinpoint what it is. He definitely isn’t harming anyone, and he’s never seen a proper horror movie, it’s just when he likes a bad guy he fixates on it and like I said it’s all he talks about until the next bad guy comes along however we took a break from the scary tonight and watched Shrek instead.

UPDATE: I wanted to update on this because I always appreciate when folks follow up. 

When I posted about BS8 sobbing and under stress from the expectations we had for him that was the worst of it. He has done so well since then! I have been relieved and proud of his strength in making better choices. I feel like what helped was encouraging him that he could do it and not backing down. He still can get edgy but much better and I hear him stopping himself from attitude on a regular basis. So thankful! 

So my thought is encourage, be hopeful, kind but stern about expectations with your kids. 


————————-
Hello I have a high energy 8 year old. He does fine in school, few behavior problems in other environments (that I am aware of). 

Our challenges with him are his complaining when he doesn't get what he wants, making fun/negativity and being argumentative. Our most common consequence has been to remove electronics as it is a motivator for him. That is the first thing to go... In addition, we might tell him we don't feel up to making his favorite food, or buying him a special food, or perhaps he might lose out on a play date as well when he is not being kind/etc. If he is really acting up in addition he is sent to his room (this entails 1-2 hours at most) which I don't like doing but it is effective. This time there have been no screens for 4 days while we encourage more positive, kind behavior - we clearly spell out what we are looking for (at least we feels it is clear and he expresses understanding), tell him we know he can do it. He continues to whine and complain, etc. We have given him consequences all along so that is not new to him. What is new is the level of adherence we are looking for as his issues are not getting better and we believe he is old enough that we can expect him to be kind, positive/neutral most of the time. We look at ourselves and work hard to make sure we don't give him attitude, negativity or argue (we are of course far from perfect here and work hard and apologize if we lose patience with him). He has never been spanked or physically disciplined, we never have called him a name, etc.... He has lots of parent and friend time and has a good daily routine, plenty of sleep and nutrition. 

What bothers me is how upset he gets saying thru sobs ""I am never getting my iPad back, I CAN'T do it (meaning he can't change his behavior, he'll say he can't help it), life doesn't matter,"" etc. He feels defeated in those moments we tell him he won't have screen time the next day. We encourage and tell him how hard it is but that we know he can do this. It's hard watching him so upset - I feel in my gut that it is just the difficulty of behavior change and tendencies that unfortunately are more natural for him.... At this point it might be weeks before he shows consistently positive behavior (I mean we are looking for 85% not 100%) and gets his iPad back. Has anyone taken screen time away for this long, or had similar challenges and can give me some encouragement? Or other things you have tried?

For reference, screen time limits have typically been 2 hours on a school day and 5 hours on off days - during the summer screen time days where he didn't have other plans could be 8-9 hours but that isn't the norm. He plays with buddies on line I can hear them talking and playing and they do pretty well for 8-9 year olds-Roblox usually.

Thanks in advance!",N/A,N/A

Things like role playing, reading stories, creating your own story together about a particular behaviour you want to see. You’ve said no complaining, being negative, arguing back- but what can he do in these situations when he is feeling angry/upset instead and focus on teaching that. It’s ok to feel angry/upset but how do we manage these emotions? All a punishment does is shut down the feeling and give no strategy on how to actually manage the feeling.

Sending him to his room for 1-2 hours is a long time for an 8 year old so I’d think about the end goal of doing this. Is the purpose to punish him? To act as a re-set? To give you a break? To give him time to regulate his emotions? A mixture of all of the above? Say for example the goal is for him to regulate his emotions- he may not know how to actually do this by himself so sending him to his room alone might not be the most effective strategy here long term, even if it is effective at shutting him down in the short term.",h8de2cg,N/A

You're training an AI robot, or trying to control a train that if it deviates from your path is considered a derailment.

>complaining when he doesn't get what he wants, making fun/negativity and being argumentative.

For complaining, and one thing I feel needs to be pointed out, is when you (parent) don't get your way, you punish him. You punishing him for complaining about not getting is way, is in fact you complaining about not getting your way. Instead of words or whining, you use actions against your son. Now, of course it isn't possible (in my mind anyway) to never punish your child. However, when he starts to complain are you asking for more details on why he feels he should get to do what he wants, and then you explain your point to his. Basically, is there an opportunity for him to complain, that you'll actively listen to him for, prior to punishment.

Making fun / being negative I feel is testing boundaries. I doubt you'll be able to squash it all, but if he makes a remark that you don't agree with are you asking him why he felt that comment was appropriate and then explaining why it wasn't?

Being argumentative is apart of growing up. Again, not a robot but a human with their own set of emotions, thoughts, enjoyments, frustrations. What might seem small to you because of your life and experience may be very large to your son.

>""I am never getting my iPad back, I CAN'T do it (meaning he can't change his behavior, he'll say he can't help it), life doesn't matter,""

This makes me feel he isn't being listened to, and that he is just expected to follow what you say. He can't not because he won't, but because it isn't him right now in this instant. He needs the guidance, communication, and support from his parents, but all he is getting is punishment.

Now, again, this could be me misinterpreting what is written here because it's impossible to sum up your entire parenting style in four paragraphs. If this doesn't apply to you, sorry. If it resonates with you at all, awesome.

We will tell him it's okay to be upset but he can't be rude to us. And we have talked about managing his emotions with different thoughts or behaviors. He knows deep breathing, talking to himself in a different way, he will ask for us to listen to what he has to say and we will. Going to the room often is for him to reset but honestly sometimes its used as a consequence when he is being extremely rude. If he asks me to come talk to him I will go in there and talk-if he is ready to discuss we do that... if he calls me in to continue telling me how angry he is at me and that I am mean, etc. I tell him we can talk later as I have already heard that before sending him to his room.

&#x200B;

It is a long time. I actually hoped I wouldn't have to send him to his room but I tried it at one point and sometimes the time alone helps him. If he gets even more dysregulated then I will go in there if I think it might help. (like if he is crying and asking for me; but if he is angry screaming I will leave him to himself for a few-this doesn't happen often maybe once/month).",h8dhqgx,h8de2cg

We can definitely be hypocritical as parents! I do tell him that we aren't allowed to be rude to him either and to let us know if we are. By complaining I mean - for example- when I ask him to go shower which he knows darn well is the routine he makes a rude noise and rolls his eyes at me. This is not okay with us. Of course it will happen every now and then but not okay as often as he does it. He likes to eye roll, make a rude noise of disgust - those are the things we aren't okay with when we are asking nicely for him to do something that is an expectation on him. But saying he is tired, bored, doesn't like school work -stuff like this- is absolutely okay as he is expressing things we all feel. So I should say its more about being rude to us. By complain I mean when we are going somewhere/doing something that isn't his first choice he might say ""This is SO boring"" with disgust and annoyance. I don't feel it's okay for him to complain like that when we are trying to enjoy ourselves. He needs to have empathy for other people's experiences in my view and learn to suppress annoyance at times. 

By negative I mean like he says dumb 8 year old stuff like I couldn't get into a website my password wasn't working and he just laughed at me like he found it amusing that I was struggling, that kind of thing. Or he will fart almost in my face, or burp over and over again when I have asked him not to. Again, not every once in a while none of us are perfect. It's just not very kind and super annoying.

We have asked him why he does stuff. A lot of the times he thinks its funny and for an 8 year old it is funny; sometimes we totally validate it that if he's around his friends and they all think its funny fine, other times we say ""It's not funny to make fun of someone who is struggling"". 

We really try and give him a path for what being kind, etc. looks like but I agree it's extremely important. On the other hand I also like something I read a long time ago I think in 1-2-3 Magic that you don't need to explain things over and over to kids in fact it can do the opposite in trying to reason/discuss. So sometimes its a hard no. But really hard to balance sometimes!! 

I know what we can work on is being more patient with him. And we also get frustrated easily (not major like road rage but we do get annoyed for sure) and I am sure as much as we try to ""hide"" it from him (meaning keep adult discussions away from him) he sees our own struggles at times. He also sees us deep breathing and trying to relax..

Was looking into financial products for kids for my own son. He’s 15, almost 16 and also managed to open a PayPal account. Venmo too. They really don’t check age… Anyway, his intentions were fairly innocent, so I’m not too angry. His first debit account was an Amex Serve account because I already had one to use for some internet purchases I didn’t trust enough for my debit card and it was easy to set up a sub account for him. He’s a gamer too and was always bugging me for my card number. I opened the account for him when he was  12 and he had PayPal opened by 13 or 14 because some game sites didn’t take Amex but took PayPal. Nothing bad happened. If he drained his Amex account he simply went without money until he got allowance or birthday/Christmas cash again. He learned fairly quickly not to drain his account without my interference. That’s the beauty of a debit account like Amex Serve. No way to overdraw. It just got declined if he didn’t have the money. If you’re worried he’ll over draw his checking and affect you, it may be worth looking into.

Venmo was opened fairly recently. He has a babysitting gig with the neighbors and they wanted to Venmo him money. He claims they didn’t even ask his age but TOS says 18. I advised him to stop using both PayPal and Venmo, because if they do catch on that he’s underage they will freeze those accounts, which means he can’t access any money he may have had in either. That’s the worst that can happen really. I’ve since opened him an actual checking account because he showed the ability to not hit zero in his Amex account for a while. He no longer needs PayPal for the purpose he was using it for as he has a debit card accepted everywhere now, and the neighbors switched to Apple Pay to pay him. 

Over the last couple years, he’s proven to be able to save rather large chunks of money for the things he wants. $2000 for a gaming computer, several hundred for gaming consoles and a VR setup. He’s saving for a car now. Mainly only buys games when they’re on sale now. He gets irate when he has to spend money generally speaking now. He has his goals and that’s what his money is for. They DO learn but I let him learn on his own really, with that Amex card at 12. He hates being broke now and avoids it at all costs. 

I recently added him as an authorized user on one of my credit cards so he can order pizza in when he’s watching his sister and what not.  He used it for a couple anime subscription services too, as he doesn’t like keeping his debit card stored in those sites. A smart move really, as credit cards offer more fraud protection. I pull the money from his checking account when they charge the card for that. Soon though, I will grant him permission to access that cards account fully so he can learn to pay credit card bills before he’s 18, with my supervision. Capital One allows that, if you’re curious. I’m currently looking into investment accounts for minors too. Leaning to Fidelity. 

So, there’s the path we’ve been taking and it’s working. You need to let him be broke I think. Also, it helped that I’ve mainly refused to buy him expensive gaming equipment myself. I don’t like that he plays so much, so he’s been on his own in getting all of that. He was motivated to learn in that way.",h4p8ukm,N/A

I’m freaking out right now because I just found out my daughter who is 11 has been on the app Avakin life. I knew she had Instagram but I thought she was only friends with her cousins on there. I’ve failed as a parent to keep my daughter safe from social media. She’s a straight A student with a heart of gold but it’s clear that she has been seeing things that are so inappropriate for her age. My husband seems to think this is what all kids do these days and isn’t nearly as in shock or concerned as I am. I don’t know who to talk to about this because I’m so embarrassed that I wasn’t more aware as a parent. She was role playing like a bisexual girl on the app. Today I had to have a talk with her about what sex trafficking is so she could be aware of how dangerous the online world is! I’ve warned her but not in detail until today.  We told her no Roblox, no talking to strangers, no inappropriate things...and it still happened. 

Helpful advice is so welcome but if you’re going to judge don’t bother. I’m judging myself enough for the both of us right now.  Help! I’m not really sure where to go from here. I wanted her to know that there is nothing wrong with being interested in girls or boys but she’s only 11. I don’t want to say or do the wrong thing as a parent from here. I want the lines of communication to be open between us. Sigh...parenting is so hard.",N/A,N/A

Don’t freak out. Don’t panic. That may make her want to keep things from you in the future. Ask her about it, what has she seen, does she have any questions, is she questioning her sexuality? Then decide what you want to do going forward with the app, if you want her to delete it, talk about other healthy communication options and ways to consider her sexuality if that’s what she needs. Talk to her about what a healthy relationship looks like, what catfishing is, what consent is etc. 


Also you’re more horrible, I’m a middle school teacher and never heard of this app. They are constantly popping up and getting more predatory and difficult to recognize.

With that said I'm going to humbly tell you that social media for 11 year olds is probably not the best move because in most cases children must be 13 to access social media and rightfully so. We do not allow our children to have social media accounts because most social media is not designed for children.

What's that said you were not the worst parent ever.
We all make mistakes.
I would calmly go to your daughter and have a conversation about what she was exposed to why the content was inappropriate. Ask her if she has any questions etc. I would also remove her ability to access social media apps and explain why you're doing this.

I'd never heard of this game until I looked it up for this post. 

The first time our kids run into trouble online was in an online video games with other people speaking to reach other guys microphones. They were saying inappropriate things. The next time was when my oldest learned to read and people were typing inappropriate things into chat. That's when we decided to not allow them to play anything with online chat (if we can turn chat off, fine). We made it clear that we were taking these things away because of other people, not because of them!!!

My oldest is 10 and has a Kindle, but it's got parental restrictions and I check it regularly to make sure he hasn't downloaded anything without my permission. I have no intention whatsoever of removing these restrictions or getting him his own phone any time soon.

We have a cheap Nokia phone only used when he goes to a friend's house alone and only capable of texts and calls. I don't understand why parents think it's responsible to give kids anything more than this before high school. (Personally, I'm not even sure we plan to give them more than this in high school either, but we'll see what life is like for kids when they actually reach that stage).

My kids know that these restrictions are not because we don't trust them. It's because we don't trust other people online. Because of parental restrictions, they have to ask us before they download anything, and in order to establish trust, we download as much of that as we can (we research it and find out the potential dangers and go ahead and download it if we feel it's safe...if for any reason we feel it's not safe, we tell them why and do some research and try and find a decent alternative that is safe). Our children trust us now when we tell them no for something, because they know that there is a reason for it and we try to compromise by finding an alternative.",grrv2yx,grrcwms

OK I know kids are gonna check stuff out and I know I did when I was a kid. But I’m 55 and things were much different back then. I think my daughter just discovered these sites this morning because they were on my phone and I’ve never seen anything like this in my browse history before.

I told her I saw it but didn’t make a big deal. I put some parental locks on but checked and some of the sites are still opening.

The thing that annoys me is she seems to be getting to them through ROBLOX. She has played for years. She is on there as a child and there are supposed to be safeguards. I do talk to her about internet safety, etc. but I can’t be there all the time

I am pretty dumb about Internet stuff. Does anyone know if there’s a way to block things on the ROBLOX site?

I realize she is going to look at stuff. Some of the stuff I saw is slightly disturbing and there’s anime porn and crap like that which grossed me out. She and I have frank talks about everything. I don’t want to freak out but I also think hardcore stuff is a lot different than looking at a playboy mag.

Anyone have any advice on the ROBLOX front?

I am dumb with internet stuff too, but I think there are ways to block the chats in roblox. I'm not sure if the chat is crucial to the game, but if it's not, then I would go ahead and disable the chat option. Also, she can block players on the game. It won't prevent people from continuing to share links or do rape-y shit, but at the very least she won't encounter the same user again. Also, just do some preliminary research on the games/apps she uses in the future just to check for any dangers. Some games/apps are better safeguarded than others.

Same age. We had child safe settings on the computer, but never realized it didn’t work on google chrome, only internet explorer. Don’t beat yourself up, but I would definitely delete roblox. I believe it needs to be installed on the computer for her to use it, so delete the program that allows her to use the site, and block the site. Mine was actually pretty ok with getting rid of it. We had a talk about it, and I know how hard it is to not freak out when you see something like that. Just try to talk with her calmly about it, so that she feels like she can tell you things in the future. Have you had “the talk” with her yet? I’d talked to her about sex briefly a few weeks before because my sister was having a baby and she was asking questions, and knew virtually nothing about where babies came from. But it is really hard to talk about what they’ve seen, like, I tried to  basically tell my daughter that any crazy person can put things on the internet and that they can put some really weird stuff up there, but sex is supposed to be a really special thing for two adults who have known each other a long time and love each other, not something that people turn into something weird and put on the internet. But people are crazy, and so things like that end up on the internet. It’s so hard to talk about without making them feel so embarrassed. 
>
I would be really careful about YouTube too. Maybe put some screen time restriction on your computer, so that she can only use it during certain hours when your home. Since you mentioned anime, I want to warn you about those Gacha Life videos too. It seems like a cute app for dressing up little characters, but the YouTube videos are almost always REALLY MESSED UP. Like 99% of them, even if they seem normal at first, you’ll find something inappropriate if you watch the whole video. Try to steer her away from gaming channels too, because that’s just going to make her want to play roblox and stuff like that more. 
>
It’s hard but for me I had to really find other things that my daughter likes to do, like rollerblading, riding bikes, drawing on the computer or in good old paper. She still plays her switch, and has more than enough video games on there, and a few on my phone as well. Just stay away from roblox no matter what, and be REALLY careful with YouTube. Those Gacha videos are what started my daughter googling “boobs”, and she went down the rabbit hole for about ten minutes and ended up on some awful site. We’ve been so much better off after taking a break from the computer and deleting roblox. It was all she wanted to do for a while there. She kind of reset after a week or so without it, and is way more responsible with her internet time now. Only sometimes watching silly videos of glitches in legend of Zelda or something. Usually she finds other things to do. She’s been loving listening to music on Alexa lately, when she’s having some alone time in her room, and she’s also gotten into reading a bit more and has been breezing through the Harry Potter series. Just try to find some other things she might like to do. Get a basketball net, or some craft supplies, or give her a little freedom riding bikes/rollerblading in front of the house if you live in a good area for that. The internet can be great, but lately I think it’s a cancer when it comes to kids. Get her into some other stuff and I’m sure she’ll forget all about it. Maybe even have her take a break from it for a week or so. Explain your not mad at her or punishing her, but you need to make sure it’s safe, and it’s not healthy to be on it too often.",g84g13i,N/A

Not all parental controls work on platforms.  If it’s an iffy situation, ie the only way it’s allowed with the parental controls, we set it up, try to break the rule; if we can’t - we watch the content that the LO is playing until we feel it’s working.  If the parental controls fail at either us or the LO then it’s a “sorry, but the game developers didn’t make the safety measures strong enough to help me keep you safe.” 

Nintendo is on point with parental controls.  It will kick them mid-battle out when time is up.   We have age settings on, but can whitelist games that are rated for older kids.

Not sure though what is safe with chatting and whatnot. I don’t let ours do any chatting. For example, there’s an app on the Kindle called Zoo Club, and the interaction is just sending game items to other people and looking at the zoos they have made. That’s the kind of thing I let them do. I don’t know how you can have a game with chatting between ONLY two people with everyone else blocked. But maybe that exists. Maybe they can just e-mail, write letters, and call.

I definitely wouldn’t get the book “It’s Perfectly Normal” because THAT is pornographic, albeit in cartoon form, but fairly graphically, and VERY extensively. Here are a few pictures from it: https://www.prolifewaco.com/uploads/5/5/3/1/55313755/normal_pictorial_coverups.pdf with the private parts covered over by the people who posted it, not by the publisher. It teaches kids to masturbate, and is pretty much “anything goes”. That’s how I was taught in my schools (also had a bizarre book when I was young, that even though it didn’t explicitly teach “anything goes”, it was graphic in a cartoon way too, but with ROBOTS 😕), and I grew up pretty confused, doing worse and worse things ONLY because I hadn’t YET done them—friends and I actually had checklists of every perverse act and used them as to-do lists—and luring and persuading others into doing them. It would have probably been most appropriate for me to have chosen St Mary of Egypt as my patron saint, because I can relate to her life especially. She said, “Already during the lifetime of my parents, when I was twelve years old, I renounced their love and went to Alexandria. I am ashamed to recall how there I at first ruined my maidenhood and then unrestrainedly and insatiably gave myself up to sensuality…doing free of charge what gave me pleasure…I had an insatiable desire and an irrepressible passion for lying in filth. This was life to me. Every kind of abuse of nature I regarded as life.… I frequently forced those miserable youths even against their own will. There is no mentionable or unmentionable depravity of which I was not their teacher.” By the most extreme asceticism maybe ever recorded, she went from one of the few most depraved women ever to one of the few most holy. (Instead I chose St Elizabeth the Grand Duchess, who was probably always very nearly pure and innocent. Not feeling worthy of any patron saint. 😬)

Anyway, if you’re a Christian, I think you should get a Christian book. If Jewish, Jewish; if Muslim, Muslim…whatever—reinforce the family’s faith. If you’re not religious, I guess this could be a good reason to look into religion. We’re Catholic, but one of the books we’ve used is Protestant, Growing Up God’s Way for Girls, because it seemed to have the necessary details but not too much. So what I think really matters is that whatever you have is consonant with your values and does not confuse or disturb children.",g84vsix,g84eywn

Thanks for checking and stopping by. It’s my payday today and checking my bank account as usual and I have seen a lot of apple.com charges. I thought my card was hacked or there has been fraud but there’s no alert from my bank at all. I use the chat option on the apple website and lo and behold; the customer service said that the Apple ID that has my card spent about $614 on Harry Potter gems. I confirmed the Apple ID that was used and it was my daughter’s apple/iTunes ID. The customer service rep said that he will try and report that the purchases were accidental but he can’t promise that it will be refunded. I have to check back within two days.

 I FaceTimed my daughter and she won’t even talk, she just told me that she was sorry that she wasn’t thinking right and that I can ground her. She doesn’t think that it’s a hard earned money from my job. Me and my husband already had a talk with her and took all her electronics away. She broke down and cried. She then told us that someone from her class was pressuring her to do all their group work on their online class; but I don’t get how it’s connected to what she did and bought from the app? Is there anything else that we’re missing or need to do? It’s her first time doing something this bad and she’s our only daughter. Her 10th birthday is also one week away and it breaks my heart having to do this to her but I have no choice.

EDIT: *For some who are saying it’s my fault, well I let her buy a coin from Roblox last December and forgot to take out my card. 🥴

*Spoke with the teacher and she put the peer pressure kid in another group. Me, my husband and her teacher will work together to help and support her. My daughter said she felt better about that. 

*Tried to file a claim with apple and they denied it. Now tried to file a claim with the Harry Potter App customer service and still waiting for a response. Will also go to my bank to inform them about the situation.

*Thank you to all who helped give good advices.",N/A,N/A

When anyone is feeling stressed and down, it tends to increase pleasure seeking behavior (and apps like that are a dopamine factory) and reduce our self control.

The fact that 10 year olds (many of which I have met online while playing my vid game) are subjected to this... makes me pretty sick.

BUT before going down that path, I wonder if her mentioning the pressure in group work at school was a small offer of her asking you to inquire more. Especially because it sounds so out of context and makes no sense in relation to spending so much money in an app.... is it possible she may be getting bullied/forced/coerced and the reckless uncharacteristic behaviour is somehow indeed tied to what she said about school?

My suggestion is that when cooler heads prevail, have an unemotional as possible conversation with her. I’m sure she understands that what she did was wrong — what you should try and get to is the why. Why did she do something so not like herself. Once you feel satisfied that you understand her perspective and reasoning, you can decide what is the right next step. Good luck OP!!",gk0fl7z,N/A

A) set her up with a list of household chores above and beyond her normal ones with a rate of pay per chore. Cleaning up dog poop from the yard pays 5 dollars. Cleaning the bathroom grout gets 10. so on and so forth. After each chore completion she has to have her work inspected and signed off upon. These chores need to be completed correctly, to the same standard you'd apply to yourself. Of course, acknowledge you will probably need to show her how to do new chores. Each completed chore deducts from her total due. 

B) help her make a poster of various household chores she's able to safely do with respect to covid( cleaning up dog poop, raking leaves, cleaning up snow, weeding gardens.) Help her advertise her new business. All earnings go to you to pay down her debt. If she's crafty, perhaps she could capitalize on that to pay down her debt.",gk0mfzh,N/A

My son has been doing the whole virtual learning thing at home for the past year. In order to get through this terribly stressful covid time, I've kind of let stuff go more than I would have because it's been hard on all of us. Well for my son, this has meant him watching a lot more tv than usual, particularly YouTube. In the beginning he was watching like Dennis daily, who was annoying sure but we all got used to it, then he found this group of people that would live stream together and play games and they weren't people I would play with but, you know, every kid has this weird awkward growing up era. Mine was playing with beanie babies and blasting nsync, they're all terrible. And I thought well he's just watching these personality type videos because he's lonely, he misses playing with friends at school, and I viewed it as a way to feel like he still had those connections. But now he's into this guy, and I can't remember the name, but one of these youtubers who does terrible things to his little friend group and calls them pranks and they all live in these giant mansions because they make a ridiculous amount of money from making videos all day every day and I'm starting to see him mimic this dude's mannerisms and I hate it. As a former emo kid, I'm a firm believer in kids needing to be able to go their own way and explore things and figure out who they are on their own...... but this? My kid is going to be that guy? I hate that guy. That's not what I wanted for him. So I find myself just snapping at him for every little thing, because he's just irritating me SO much! I kept telling myself that oh this is just a phase but each section of this phase has just gotten worse and worse and I'm wondering if at some point I need to put a stop to it so that I don't turn around when he's 18 and wonder how the hell did he wind up like this?? I don't know. Any experiences or advice you guys have to give would be greatly appreciated.",N/A,N/A

I firmly believe YouTube is toxic to kids (everyone really). This stranger is heavily influencing your child. Restrict the age content or block YouTube all together. 

Personally, I’d go cold turkey. Put all the devices away and plan an entire day out. Distract him and then when you get home (if/when he asks) “we’re taking a break from devices as a family. Let’s choose something else to do.” Then do it. Go for a walk, play a board game, do whatever he asks. You should also lead by example and limit your devices. Write up a list of things to do other than devices (draw, library, swim, stem project, etc). Eventually you can decide if/when to reintegrate devices. Limit to an hour or two and what content he can view. 

It will be a tough few days and probably some emotional drama but you’ll survive and both will be better off for it.",h1fb2w9,N/A

Without getting into details, I have a little girl who watches youtube 95% of her days, most of which are roblox and peppa pig, but ultimately a lot of glamour and makeup stuff gets filtered onto her account and she's recently gotten lipstick and a mini-makeup kit.  At home, she dresses like a lack of potato and due to covid, she's home all day every day. How do I (M), teacher her to value her own natural looks, and that makeup is mostly for fun? 

She and I have read a book titled ""Dear Girl"" by Amy Krouse about 2 yrs ago and she says she's forgotten the content but not the title, I plan to revisit the book.  However, I fear that the constant youtube will out-influence her self image over my infrequent opportunities.

A lot of them are about having fun with makeup (many of her challenge videos make me laugh) and doing it for yourself, instead of doing it to impress others, Unless you want to impress them with your mad skillz. 

As a human (adult) female, I grew up with media telling me that makeup is needed to be pretty. I also grew up with a father who didn't want to buy me make up/wanted me to focus on Inner beauty. While I applaud the idea to focus on ""being beautiful without makeup"", it has backfired into me feeling so extremely self conscious when wearing makeup. I can't easily wear it for fun anymore.

That share positive messages, similar to the one you hope to reach your daughter. Perhaps, watch these type of videos yourself. Find some of these people, and encourage your daughter to watch them. I know that Molly Burke is a youtuber that shares positive messages. Perhaps start there.  I’m sorry I can not help more.

I’ll try my best to keep it short & to the point. 

I have an 11 year old daughter & she discovered porn on YouTube at about 6 or 7 years old using voice command on our tablet. If you weren’t already aware, there is full penetration on YouTube. When I spoke to her about it then, she told me that an older kid at school told her & her friends that they could use voice command to ask YouTube to show you whatever you wanted. She searched things like “twerking” & “bras” then got a little more comfortable & asked “will you show me a boys wiener please.” It all felt very innocent & like she was just curious.

We took the tablet away & practically banned her from YouTube for like a year. I know that’s extreme but I was freaked out. Between then & now my husband & I have “caught” her watching porn on YouTube by checking the history & most recently she was using one of the unused profiles on our Netflix account late at night to watch all of the raunchiest & sex related shows. We had another talk about why it’s not appropriate for her & if she had questions to come ask us. We never wanted to embarrass her especially because when I was her age I did the same thing, stayed up late til my parents fell asleep & watched everything on hbo. 

Last year her best friend got into trouble for talking to people online & sending them photos on Snapchat. This was a huge deal & sparked all of us moms to have the internet safety talk & explained to our kids how dangerous it is to talk to strangers online. My kid always swore that she’d never do that & that she knew it was bad. 

She was introduced to the game IMVU recently & we thought it was just a more updated game similar to Roblox with better graphics. This weekend we found out that this game is basically social media for kids that are trying to appear older than they are. If your kids play this game, I urge you to ban it from your household. My daughter’s dad called me this weekend & told me that she had been playing the game on his phone & just discovered the messages. The things that she was saying to the boys on that game made me feel sick to my stomach. She spoke with so much maturity. She called one boy “daddy” & when he asked if she was dtf she told him yes. Another boy asked if she had Snapchat & she told him not anymore. The conversations didn’t go any further than that but you can imagine our horror. My husband & I talked to her that night & her dad picked her up the next day & talked to her about it too. We took the scare tactic approach & talked about sex trafficking, rape & stds. 

She seemed apologetic but honestly I feel like I don’t know my kid. I know that I can’t shelter her from everything. To make matters worse she’s becoming really sneaky. For example, she’s taking her laptop that’s used for distance learning into her room at night & lying about where it is. My husband & I usually make her bring it into our room before bed but didn’t last night. This morning I asked where it was & she said it was in my room. I watched her walk into my room then out & into her bedroom to grab it. She lied to my face without even thinking twice. We’re taking away tv privileges & adding more chores but I’m honestly not sure what else to do about this. I don’t know if therapy is needed or what. I don’t want to just call this a “part of growing up” because I disagree with that statement. If anyone has any experience or advice, our family would greatly appreciate it.

TLDR: My 11 year old daughter is watching porn & talking to people online. We need advice on how to handle it.",N/A,N/A

- supervision while she's on devices is absolutely the first thing that needs to happen

- a lot more conversations about sex and porn about the fact that it's not reality, that it's acting, that real sex looks different (and why/how)

- stop trying to scare her with stories of rape and sex trafficking. Talk to her about safe sex (and relationships not just sex), how she knows she's ready for sex/intimacy, consent, maturity etc.

You think she's too young but she's telling you that she's curious and if you don't give her the information and make it safe to find the information she needs then she's going to go elsewhere and she will be at risk of unsafe practices.

You need to be having open conversations and making sex a really open topic in your house so she feels comfortable discussing it with you",g20ydd1,N/A

My middle schoolers are allowed to use the family desktop that is in a common area of the house. They have laptops that they will use for distanced learning but all distance learning will be taking place in our basement and I'll be down there to supervise my younger two. At 11 my kids did not have smartphones. They had prepaid dumb phones without apps or internet access. Kids that age don't understand the gravity of what they are doing because they are kids. No talking is going to get through to them because they have already decided that everything you say is an overreaction. It does get better and easier but 11 is not a good age for unsupervised internet access.,g20xbnz,N/A

Once they discover it and become interested, much to our exasperation as parents it is impossible to undiscovered it.  They know it’s there, they are going to keep looking for it.  There was also an issue with him developing a “relationship” with a “16 year old girl” (read: pedophile) online using the library computer on Discord (beware of Discord, a lot of sickos on there)- so we banned him from the library computers and he can only use the computer at home which is in the living room. My son is 15 now, we switched to iPhones and other Apple devices specifically so I can use screen time restrictions to limit his internet access, block YouTube and prevent him from downloading inappropriate apps without permission and have password locked YouTube on the Smart TVs in the house. (Imagine the embarrassment and horror of turning on the TV with guests over and YouTube porn popping up as the last thing browsed lol) I also regularly browse through his phone at random to make sure nothing concerning on there.  This level of monitoring seems drastic to parents who have been lucky enough not to have had such issues -  but for us it’s been the only thing that really works. The issue with online porn these days is not only the accessibility- but the access to some really very deviant and even violent images - nothing like the playboy type porn when we were kids - and a lot of it is specifically targeting children using characters from popular kids cartoons and shows like Mario, My Little Pony, Steven Universe etc.... I’ve seen it all and some is more incredibly sick and disturbing than any regular porn I’ve ever seen.  And many of these forums where they are finding this stuff are trolled by grown adults looking to draw out young kids both boys and girls.  It’s scary.  

So, monitor monitor monitor!  And keep addressing it.  Make sure they know there’s nothing wrong with being interested in boys or curious about sex, but that the stuff she sees in porn isn’t exactly normal or healthy relationships and why it’s important to wait until she is old enough, etc.... And don’t let people tell you just to let your kid “figure it out on their own” as I have been told many times.  People who say that either have never been on the internet or don’t understand how things have changed since we were kids.",g210han,N/A

It's more of a 13+ kind of game. Second Life is similar but its 18+.

Nothing really bad happens on IMVU persay but it is often used by people to talk to others in a suggestive way. It doesn't have to be used that way of course but  since she is moving conversations off of there that does make things seem concerning.  I went through some similar things around 12-14 and i'd personally have a younger relative/peer talk to her about things, like a cousin. It's very uncomfortable to talk to your parents about this sort of stuff at that age.  

For me at that age, the internet was just an escape from my dreadful school life. I was bullied everyday and people were nice to me online. Her calling people ""daddy"" in a suggestive way at that age is certainly concerning but be careful with how you talk to her about things- my mom never gave me ""the talk"" and was extremely judgmental and harsh to me when she found out I even masturbated.  Really affected my trust/comfort level with her. 

If it makes you feel any better I never got in any  truly dangerous situations from what I did online, I never met up with anyone. Every kid is different though so I do understand the concern.",g23exhn,N/A

A neighbor had come down and was playing at our house in the yard with my three oldest (12, 10 and 7). He was a neighborhood kid, who they had played with on numerous occasions, therefore, I had no concerns as to what they were all doing, they all played in the yard, or would go to the park down the street after asking permission. I knew that he had somewhat of a troubled home life (from what I could tell from the information I had gathered from him, my kids, and the other kids in the neighborhood. That didn’t necessarily bother me, if anything I would have welcomed him to come down more often, in order to be away from his home life. Although, for that exact reason, my kids were not allowed to go down to play at his house. They had been out playing for a while, when all of a sudden, my 7 year old (her sister) came in and let me know that her sister was watching something inappropriate on her phone. So I brought her in and asked to look at her phone and she got really defensive, telling me “she wasn’t doing anything!” Anyone who has kids can tell you that when they do that, that’s exactly the opposite of the truth!

So I grabbed her phone from her and looked at the search history in her browser, and lo and behold, there was quite an extensive history in her phone of her visiting the Pornhub website (I had parental controls on her phone)!! I was shocked, devastated, and an array of other emotions that I don’t even think I would be able to put into words. I instantly just blew up and began screaming at her, sending the other two of my kids (who had come inside behind her presumably to see her get in trouble) outside. As soon as they were outside, I (regretably) went spastic on her! Took away her phone, grounded her, there’s probably more that was said and done, but those were two of the first things I did and then sent her straight to her room.

The days following that incident, I was very distraught about knowing that she had even been subjected to those videos! I was upset, I went through feeling as if I had failed her as a mother, I wondered where she had even learned about this website, how long this had been going on behind my back, etc. I experienced emotions that I had never felt in my life. I thought her perception of sex would now be construed for the rest of her life, that she’d never be able to have a normal sex life and that she would view all sex as what she had seen on this site.

After several days, I realized that as much as I was actually dreading and drawing out having to sit and have a conversation about this, that it actually needed to happen sooner rather than later. I called her into my bedroom, and sat her down on my bed and calmly as I possibly could, just jumped right into the conversation, of course not having any clue of where to actually begin!! I first asked her where she had heard/found out about this website, she said from the neighbor boy they had been playing outside with earlier that day. I then explained to her that websites such as the one she was viewing were for much older people/couples than herself. I told her that they were websites that were viewed by some adults at different points in their life, but that they of course were not for children of her age, or even teens to be viewing because sex in real life was extremely different from how it was depicted on that site.

She began crying and telling me that she was sorry, that it would never happen again, and I explained to her that I was sorry about how I had reacted to the situation, that I was wrong in yelling and screaming at her, but that I obviously had never had to deal with a situation like this and that my emotions had got in the way and taken over when I should have excused myself, went to the other room and calmed myself down before I had actually confronted her about it, and after that we ended the conversation. She was still grounded from her phone and had to stay in the house for the rest of the week.

Not even a couple days later, her brother (10) came to me and told me that she was on the same website, but on the iPad (which also had parental controls)!! This time I was beyond pissed off! How could she do this again after our conversation?!?!? How was the parental controls on the devices letting her get through to this website?!?! And I wondered if this was a much bigger issue than I had thought it was initially due to the fact that she kept going back to this website!

Again, I went in and grabbed the iPad and sure enough, the search history showed she had been coming out to get the iPad before everyone else was awake in the morning and taking it back to the bedroom and getting back on this website. Although I was fuming just as much as I was the first time, my demeanor was much more calm! I called her again into my room, but this time, asked her why she had lied to me about not ever getting on that site again, why she though I was so stupid that she didn’t think I would find out again, and let her know she had just gained herself another week of being grounded from not only her phone, and playing with friends, but now also the iPad!!!

Eventually, she became ungrounded, got her phone back, and the kids got the iPad back as well, only instead of trusting the parental controls, I just removed the browsers from all devices completely, and still then I would go in and check both every couple days! I have not seen the website in any of the history since then (I reinstalled the browsers on both devices, for schoolwork reasons mostly) but have very closely monitored it on a regular basis!

Even though the website has not shown up in the history, of course I can’t be 100% for sure that she has not been back to it, because of course, I ‘m sure she would be smart enough to delete it from the history now, since before she got in trouble for it. The boy that introduced her is no longer allowed down at our house, and they are no longer allowed to play with him and I have explained to both him and my kids why! Although, even though all this is good, I have recently found letters in her SCHOOL EMAIL, and in her school papers that she had written to one boy down the street where they have discussed dating, basically “I like you, do you like me”, “am I your girlfriend?”, songs and such written back and forth and other things that is just silly middle schooler stuff that I haven’t really made too much of a fuss about (except the school email thing, which I didn’t specifically bring the email up itself, but just informed her that anyone at the school has access to her email and can view anything that she has in there, to which I saw the look on her face that showed me, she instantly knew what I was talking about and told her she needed to go delete it immediately)!!

So I can only imagine that there is going to be SEVERAL more instances like this one that we will have to deal with in the future, but I’m not going to worry about them until they actually come up or I will drive myself nuts!!! And you better believe her devices are a lot better monitored nowadays!!!

I got into nsfw things at around nine years old after stumbling across some rather nsfw fanfiction and it steamrolled after there. 

I did all the things your daughter is doing: exchanging nudes, camming, talking to strangers, etc. The core of why I did this is because I liked the attention- it felt pretty good to have older men telling me they wanted to pay me when people my age thought I was kind of ugly, and because I was doing something other people my age weren't; I knew about every kink you could name and it helped me find my own sexuality. It also helped me come to terms with what I felt when I was assaulted. 

When this broke out when I was 17, my mother handled it poorly, but it frightened me into stopping the camming and just reading and watching nsfw content instead, since she was threatening to kick me out. I would really commend how you haven't reacted to this in anger, as I still haven't gotten over the sick feeling in my stomach of my mother describing my nudes to me. 

In your case, as someone who knows exactly what your kiddo is going through, I would continue being supportive, I would start complimenting her more, I would restrict her internet access and give her a conversation about how porn isn't real, I would enrol her in an extracurricular activity (starting a job was my blessing as it distracted me and gave me pride in another area) and most importantly, I would send her to a psychologist. 

A professional could help her in ways you don't realise and it could give her a chance to say things she can't to her parents. Some sexual exploration is normal at that age, like masturbating and curiousity towards pornograohic material, but talking to others isn't and right now she probably doesn't realise how unsafe it is. There is nothing wrong with your kid and this isn't the result of bad parenting, don't worry. This is a sticky situation and so far you've handled it exceptionally.

He also doesn’t try new games because he is afraid of failing, even simple board games. This behavior is fairly recent. I wonder if this it started because he would play video games with his cousins who are competitive and trash talk.

He is also very hard on himself, he says things like “I’m someone whose problems can’t be solved” “there’s nothing you can do I’m always bad at it” “It’s impossible” “I suck” etc. One time he was answering a quiz game for online school and he was in a great mood when he got answers right. But the second he got a mistake he would get angry, very much at himself. Then lose all interest and put up a fight the whole way through and complain. This of course makes him hate school.

I also noticed a behavior where for the things he does think he’s good at (like playing roblox) he’s very very protective of his competence and thinks he knows everything about it. Often immediately negating anyone that tries to give him information on it (ex. Older brother told him that video games were made of codes and he violently insisted they weren’t) He complains the moment something goes wrong also.

I don’t think he’s spoiled because he helps out around the house and even enjoys doing things independently. He has an older brother 15yo who does well in school, is an athlete etc. Older brother cares about him and tries to tell him not to get affected by failing, but this may come out as nagging or criticizing.

Honestly the whole thing is heartbreaking because this kid is also one of the sweetest, most thoughtful children and so is his brother. He would offer you the last of his precious ice cream if he feels bad that you didn’t get to have any. He would offer to contribute from his own savings if he suspects there are money problems. He always tries to help his mother, who just developed an auto immune disorder. He even apologizes for his behavior after it happens. 

I just want to know what strategies we should adopt as a family to stop this behavior? And what caused this sudden change in him? Any resources would help too.",N/A,N/A

He needs a ton of positive reinforcement, a confidence boost and some coping tips about dealing with trash talking; that it’s a form of other people making themselves feel better by making other people feel bad. If he realizes that he is being manipulated then maybe it won’t bother him as much. But negativity is hard to deal with in general. We all know a negative nelly and to a large degree it’s their personality. Maybe it’s a personality disorder, but those aren’t really diagnosed or treated in children.

I wait for him to calm down and then offer him help if possible. 

For example yesterday he was trying to replicate something his friend had built with wooden blocks and he couldn’t balance them right so I offered to help and then he watched me try to build the same thing. It fell at least 7 times before I was able to actually make the tower and each time I quickly calmly said “Oops, gotta start over” or something to let him know that I was sad it fell but I could keep going. 

I’m not sure how to apply this to an older child and to activities like a video game, but whenever you do interact with your son try to be as vocal as you can about the little mistakes you make and how you move on from them. Kids learn the most by watching us, and right now he might feel like he’s the only person in the world who ever messes up.",g0seize,N/A

That's why he thinks he's bad at everything and immediately feels threatened when people are better than him at stuff he's good at. It has nothing to do with him being spoiled.

Make sure he gets a lot of positive reinforcement from you. Praise him for stuff he does, especially if he's persistent. Encourage him to keep trying things, and tell him you know he can do it. Tell him you're proud of him. Bring up his strengths and achievements unprompted.

You also need to figure out where his low self-esteem is coming from. Talk to him about it. Maybe it has something to do with school. It could also be that he compares himself to his successful older brother a lot and thinks he can't measure up. If it's not that, there could be a thousand other reasons. Talk to him and find out together. Be empathetic and help him get over his insecurities. Tell him why the sad stuff he believes about himself isn't true.

Fail. Fail better.” I like to get things right but I’m human. I will screw up. I emphasis with kids when I make a mistake and what I’m feeling, and how I get past that feeling to the next one until I can try again. I see this with kids that had trauma (not making assumptions, just the area I work in) and needing to control and make things perfect as so much around them is out of their control. I’ve had kids curse themselves out for messing up a coloring page. I’ll grab it from the trash and say it’s too beautiful and if they don’t like it then I will put it up on my fridge. I’ll see and try to color with them and let them see my terrible skills. We focus on “Best is different than perfect. Did you try? Did you learn? Then you did your best.” We talk about the difference between the “right way, wrong way” and “my way, your way”. That is usually where we try weird ice cream toppings. I try to empower with choices: homework is not optional, so how to we handle the mad to help us get back to work? We can sing a loud song, we can ask for help, or we can read our instructions again.
You can also help him to see the difference between the shade of angry: it’s not working, I don’t understand, you’re not listening, and I can’t do this are the flavors I see. (I like ice cream metaphors.) We work on “Pause” when the big emotions start to breathe deep, think about our words, and then talk. Later on you can do the post game: “When you got mad at the puzzle, I was very proud of how you took a Pause. Using your words to ask for help, let me see what you needed from me. How did you know you were getting mad?” You can also tell him when you get mad and do the post game. “I was mad when you yelled at your brother. I’m glad we both got to take a Pause to calm down. I want to help you, but we do not yell at each other. It’s hurtful and we have better ways to use our words. If you want to tell me now, we can talk with your brother about what you trying to tell him.” It’s also totally okay to let the kids see you take a Pause. How you utilize and model in your life (and even your older son) helps show that you believe in it and use it. Hope this helps.",g0us0m9,N/A

(Before you get worried, it’s a spectrum so his symptoms could be subtle. It could be good to know!) There is a type of ADHD that is not hyperactive, and it is very subtle an often missed in children. (I was diagnosed as an adult and have it, but no one ever noticed in my growing up, so I’m very familiar.) Symptoms that stood out to me for him include:
1. Low self esteem (Due to small errors and adhd symptoms, studies show kids with ADHD on average get 20,000 more negative messages by the 5th grade than kids without it) Also emotional ups and downs come with ADHD. 
2. Weak executive functioning (you can google this to see if it sounds like him - but some examples are: memory, to-do list completions, remembering the second task after being told the first, disorganization and dislike for cleaning and organizing.)
3. 5-10% of people have ADHD - so there’s a one in ten or twenty chance. (And learned this: it persists in adulthood, but coping mechanisms make it harder to see. So our peers and family and coworkers have it too!)
4. It is very genetic, (so often parents don’t recognize the differences in thinking, because the kid is like themselves.)
5. Also thought of this because I was reading There is a potential link recently studied between auto-immune disorders and ADHD. Which raises the probability if his sweet mom has an AID and ADHD, passed down to him. (Not proven, just correlated)
6. I mentioned emotional dysregulation, but specifically having a temper when making mistakes is one symptom. (Especially when children don’t know how to verbalize what they are thinking clearly due to exec functioning deficit.)
7. Kids with adhd usually also are quite compassionate and sweet - have big hearts!

There are a ton of other symptoms and every case looks different, but I’d look into it if I were you! (May not be him at all, you’d know best.) 

Something to consider for either this child or another. Good to educate ourselves! A lot of psychiatrists don’t know a ton about “ADHD inattentive type” (aka not hyperactive) especially in girls (it presents differently, more likely to be inattentive type) so I was misdiagnosed without it as a kid and just now diagnosed as a 33yo. Wish I knew when I was younger to help myself work with my brain earlier! Agree with above ideas nonetheless.

(We even have a similar childhood attitude it sounds like). I’d just like to add three things for OP. 

I’m going to start sounding like a broken record because this might be the fourth time I’ve brought it up on this sub - but look into growth mindset. It’s the concept that you grow and learn through making mistakes and failures. [ClassDojo](https://ideas.classdojo.com/b/growth-mindset) has some excellent short videos that I’ve used with first through third graders to introduce the concept (I’ve liked watching them as a way to teach myself to talk to kids about it too). One of the easiest changes to make is to start using the word “yet.”  “I can’t do this” becomes “I can’t do this yet” which has a completely different attitude behind it. 

It’s really powerful for kids to see their parents (or older siblings) admit they don’t know something or fail and make mistakes. If you make a mistake (or don’t know something), mention it and model through talking aloud how you’re going to fix it and learn from it. Make sure he knows it’s not a big deal to not know something or to make a mistake. If you have a new hobby, or a hobby where you’re pushing yourself, that’s a good opportunity, or play his game with him and show him it’s not a big deal if you lose. I think a lot of times adults try to hide mistakes but it’s so good for kids to see that we’re not perfect. 

Try to complement your son on specific actions rather than static traits. So “I noticed/liked that you did _______” rather than “You are so _______”. I made another comment with the example of saying “I see you are adding a lot of detail to your trees.” rather than saying, “You’re so good at drawing.” This helps a kid to separate their worth from these traits. If you think a strength of your sons is his kindness and generosity, make sure he knows you’ve noticed that. I’d be specific and say, “I noticed you shared your ice cream, that was very generous.” 

It can take a while to retrain how you talk to your kid, but I’ve seen this really help kids with similar attitudes to your son.",g0uux0d,g0si25m

As far as where the low self-esteem is coming from... it sounds like he's a sensitive boy who is not feeling recognized for ""who he is"" (which is more than just kind of course). He is looking for value and recognition in places he can't measure up: an older brother who is more mature, athletic, academic, etc; cousins who aspire to dominance as a ""mistaken goal"" perhaps from their own insecurities.

What is he missing? Perhaps models and community that show him how he can be valued, recognized, and appreciated for himself, rather than for being outstanding by some ""other"" standards. He sounds very sensitive, and if his sensitivity is based strongly on identification with others (""becoming"" like his cousins after spending time with them, ""becoming"" the person who looks like they need money as the foundation of his generous act, etc), then you can look for ways to expose him to self-confident versions of who you think he really potentially can be. This could be in person (friends and peers) as well as from afar (watching or reading about public figures, etc).

tl;dr: he may be looking for himself in places he can't find it.",g0suv9x,g0sfvw9

My generation was when people were just kinda figuring out self esteem and so we all got praised like crazy. But now, as a teacher, we have trainings all the time on how to give specific praise that targets the process and effort, not the end result. Making comments on what you see instead of passing judgment on it is something we’re encouraged to do, although that one is harder for me. For example you might say, “I see you’re adding a lot of detail to the trees in your painting.” Instead of, “You’re good at drawing.” Or “I think your trees are pretty.”

ETA: The reason you want to give specific praise and not just say, “You’re so smart.” Is after hearing that enough it kinda sets up kids to feel like failures when they eventually hit something that’s hard. It makes them feel dumb and if they aren’t the smart kid anymore, who are they or what’s their worth?",g0uqsg6,g0shttx

My 7 year old boy is starting to become a ""No"" boy.  Want to go for a bikeride?  ""No"".  Want to go throw the frisbee? ""No"".  Want to go swim in the ocean with that fancy new wetsuit I just bought you?  ""No"".  Want to play video games? ""YES!!!""

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore.  I mean sure I love playing video games too.   But that's all this kid thinks about and dreams about and talks about.  Roblox.  OMG Roblox.

&#x200B;

We're sticking to pretty strict guidelines about gaming.  Not during the week.  And we have a limiter on the tablet set to one hour, which we usually end up resetting once or twice on a Saturday to give him another hour because he's begging for it.  Mom and Dad also play PlayStation with him (on the weekends), Minecraft, gran Turismo, etc...but we don't have the attention span he does when it comes to them.  He whines, and his attitude just sinks when its time to stop playing...stomps to his room.

&#x200B;

He's almost becoming...a recluse.  He's our only son and he's got two neighborhood girlfriends, but no dudes to play with around us.  And since COVID less interaction with kids in general I guess.

&#x200B;

My wife has been worried for some time now that he's ""not developing"", or ""might have a learning disability"".  I totally disagree with her diagnosis...he's smart, empathetic, strong, built well, good genes...but I'm now starting to get worried myself about his attitude.  He's getting quiet.  Harder to talk to.   What are you thinking about? I ask.  Nothing Dad.  Maybe I'm a bit worried, that she's worrying too much.  Or that we're not being the best ""only child"" parents.  I dunno.  

&#x200B;

I think we've done an ok job so far...but I'm starting to get worried that he's not being as productive as he should be.  Or that I could be doing something different here to make things better?  Or doing something better to make things different?

&#x200B;

How do other parents combat this?  Please help.",N/A,N/A

Stop giving into the begging for more screen time. Its hard but he has already learnt begging gers what he wants. You have to undo that. Teach begging is not how to get qhat he wants.

There's too much demand right now. prices are higher than normal for laptops. There's a cheaper dual core AMD model or dual core Intel model that could be fine for your kid but might require a RAM upgrade fairly soon.

My wife and I work from home and are super busy - kids (M-7, F-9) camps all cancelled and are struggling to keep kids off of screens. I've tried setting up ipads as managed devices and set up screen time- even locking down individual apps like Roblox- but somehow they have figured out how to ignore the locks and extend the time. 

Even if I could successfully lock out ipads, there's the Switch (which actually does have a solid parental limit) and multiple TVs. Then they start guilting me into turning on the iPads as thats the only way they keep in touch with their friends (those that also have ipads/itunes accounts). I could remove all non-educational games from the ipads which wouldn't go over well or simply get rid of ipads all together. I'm not trying to make friends, I'm trying to raise kids that can be bored and figure out creative things to do.

Anyway, I'm considering getting a lockable box (that allows charging) to keep all devices and TV remotes, but not sure if these have worked for anyone else? I want to really commit to it as they aren't cheap.",N/A,N/A

So for us (8y & 10y) during the week, as long as their house work / schoolwork is done they can do as they like.  Saturday is open (unless we have a planned family activity) and on Sundays we have no electronics.  So that means on Sundays they have a really long block of time where they have to find stuff to do.  This limits the battles, we've been doing it since they were young and they don't even question it.  I think the keys are to be consistent, reasonable, and clear / non-negotiable. 
 For the summer, since school is out, we asked them to pick a 3 hour block of time with no electronics each day (same time every day).   The only other thing we do is if anyone starts to get really amped up or angry we call a gaming time out - ""Games are supposed to be fun.  You are not having fun so take a break and you can play again when you are feeling normal"".

So I wouldn't be into the idea of locks and stuff - if my kid is so not trustworthy or responsible around the device that I have to lock it up, he's clearly not ready to have access to the device.  Right?

One family I know, each kid has a crate in the kitchen and there's a schedule on the wall above it.  When they come home from school, backpacks go in the crate for example.  The book they are currently reading at home goes in the crate.  And their devices go in the crate (can be plugged in there).   At non-screen times, the devices go in the crates.  At bedtime, the devices go in the crates.  Etc.  And that's that.  Once this had been implemented and consistently enforced, the parents don't even really have to ask anymore.  The kids know what goes where and when, and they maintain the system.

Then it's your job not to respond to guilt.  If they want to interact with friends let them use their screen time to do that.  Maybe in your case, the crates go in your home office or whatever so that especially at first you can supervise and enforce.",fvyo3fk,N/A

It sounds like your daughter can retain information fine and is completely happy to learn. It sounds like she is incredibly averse to learning or doing anything school-related, which is not the same thing. I've heard of Roblox but am not particularly familiar with it; does she make games on it or can you see that she plays it in a particularly mindless way? Generally children do have a drive to learn, they just might not apply it to the things we think they should (or know they should given what they'll need to know and do as adults). Can you identify activities where your daughter does exhibit motivation, creativity, an ability to retain information, even use some basic skills she doesn't use academically like reading, writing or counting? If so, maybe listing those for yourself and using them to remind yourself that your daughter is a capable person with (at least some) skills and qualities could help you feel a bit better. Your view of the situation and of your daughter seems to be very negative, even despairing in your post, and that might not only be painful for you it might also affect your daughter. Also if you do identify channels where your daughter does seem to thrive and learn it could help give ideas on how to help her do better in school in general (and I say ""give ideas"" in the most tentative way possible; whatever you actually end up doing I think you'd want to be careful you don't ""contaminate"" things she loves with the taint of ""school"", which it sounds like she hates to an almost pathological extent. I also think it's worth separating knowing things in general with doing well at school: one can theoretically be very good with skills in certain contexts, but be completely unable to apply them in a school setting. If your daughter got to that point it wouldn't be ideal, doing well at school is important, but it would still be better than not knowing the things at all. And ""translating"" one's knowledge into schoolwork is a different problem from learning the things to begin with).

I'm sorry your mother calls you a failure; of course it is never easy when our child has difficulties and it can be hard to silence the voices saying it's our fault, especially when it's people we love and respect literally telling us this.

I was going to suggest a second opinion, but I guess you're kind of stuck either way if there's no way to get her evaluated right now.  I still wouldn't punish her though.  If anything it will make her hate school and learning even more.  I know you said you have tried apps and programs already, so my next thought since she likes roblox was maybe trying to find a game that involves simple math for her to play, but I'm sure you've already tried that.  

I'm not sure what kind of math 3rd graders are doing these days, so I'm referring to the Khan Academy 3rd grade math course for ideas.  Maybe instead of sitting and doing worksheets you could try to make it visual or tactile, like cutting a circle into pieces to show fractions, or using pompoms or something else small to do adding/subtracting/division/multiplication, making big shapes out of tape on the floor and using a ruler to measure to teach perimeter and area, using different sized measuring cups and colored water to teach volume, etc.  Maybe if you can make it fun and engaging she can learn the concepts more easily and won't be as upset about completing her work when she understands it better?

For reading/writing maybe try to go with her interests - if she really loves horses for example, find books about horses or kids horseback riding, and read with her alternatingpages or paragraphs.  For writing, you could find some simple writing prompts and take turns writing sentences to make a story, then maybe even have her draw some pictures and get it printed and you could read that together too.  Try to follow her interests as much as possible and engage her as much as you can.  

School may still be a sticking point, but I know that kids who feel they have fallen behind often end up hating school because they don't understand the concepts and feel like they're not good enough.  Maybe if you can help her to build up her skills she will be more able to keep up in school and end up hating it less.  It must be very intimidating to her to sit down with you with a paper in front of her of things she doesn't understand and be told she needs to finish the work on it before she can do what she enjoys.  Try to make learning fun for her, but also hopefully you can get her evaluated sometime soon since there probably is some underlying issue that is making this so hard for her.  Good luck and I hope you and your daughter find a way to make learning a positive experience for her!",gglfe0q,gglbw6j

I’m on mobile so will try to keep this clean. 
I have three kids ages 7,9,13.   Middle child is female. Not really relevant unless you think it is. 

I also have zero parent friends with whom to compare /ask advice. 

Everyday I go to work 9-5 and get home And each kid wants to play. I essentially give each kid 1 hour of one on one play time. 

So from 6-9 pm I’m playing. Nearly Everyday. I’ll randomly skip a day but the mom guilt it real and when they ask to play I rarely say no. I don’t want them to feel neglected. 

Play examples. Youngest like to play soccer outside or play action figures. Middle child wants to play roblox. And oldest wants to play video games. 

Point being I work all day. Come home and play all night. I’m exhausted but I see it as - I brought them into the world, and it would be really crappy to not give them the best experience I can. 

My parents never really spent time with me. So of course that’s part of why I give in too.  Extra details. I am the biological mother and I’m married to a woman who also mothers them during the day (sahm ). The play thing is just with me though. 

Anyways. I love my kids. This isn’t that. I’m just curious for those parents who have multiple kids.... what’s your weekly afternoon look like ? Am I doing too much ? Are you all doing something similar ? Is this maybe a bad thing (too much on demand attention)?",N/A,N/A

While what you are doing is great, it isn't essential, especially if you don't get anything out of it.

But if you want some time to yourself that’s understandable too. It’s good for kids to be able to entertain themselves and play on their own, as well as get used to not always getting their way, as in having to participate in an activity that isn’t their first choice.

Which would be fine if it wasn't weighing on you, but it clearly is. When do you guys even have dinner, or do chores, homework, or any of those things?

&#x200B;

I don't have multiple children and my son is quite young, but I don't spend that much time playing with my kid. Or maybe that's not quite accurate to say because I feel my necessary care time (dressing, feeding...) is quite playful. We also walk/bike home from daycare which also translates to a solid hour of outside fairly playful time. I'm basically buying the notion that ""quality time"" can occur during basic care tasks, as long as we do those tasks with our full focus on our child (which I don't always, but I try to keep it in mind). If I have to spend 30mn with my kid and we also need to get dressed, I'll take 30mn goofing off while getting dressed over efficient dressing and then dedicated playing time every time. I also feel that children and adults just play very differently, and child play is such an important activity and one that adults just aren't very well-suited to. Not to say children and adults shouldn't play together, but that playing with an adult cannot fully replace or substitute for playing with other kids or solo play. I think you need them all as part of a complete breakfast. In other words, I think that while my child deserves my time and attention and care, I think it's appropriate for a minority of that time and attention and care to occur during dedicated play activities.

&#x200B;

Your children are older so it's not quite the same situation; they need less physical care and their play is closer to adult play than a toddler's is. But I think the general principle still applies. I asked when you guys even have dinner or do chores, because those can also be opportunities for together time, with the benefit that you're getting stuff done (chores, homework) or it's time you'd have to spend with them anyway (dinner). What activities do you enjoy, that you might engage in if you weren't spending 3 hours playing every evening? Some of those I'm sure would be pure ""relax away from the kids"" stuff, but some are maybe things you can do with one or more of your kids - more together time, but you're bringing the kid(s) into your world instead of vice-versa.

&#x200B;

>I’m exhausted but I see it as - I brought them into the world, and it   
would be really crappy to not give them the best experience I can.

It sounds like you're doing that! I don't mean with the playing, I mean in general. I think it's worth considering your own burnout level - there is definitely a tradeoff where we do need to make sacrifices for our children, but it's also true that our children will have a better experience if we aren't completely miserable. Certainly playing with someone is more enjoyable if they're totally into it, and aren't checked out or trying hard to be into it but struggling internally. I'm sure there's always going to be a percentage of the time when we give our children our attention but it's draining and we don't get that much out of it (it certainly happens a lot with me), but I think it's worth finding ways of minimizing that percentage, and trying to increase the quality time that we get something out of.",h08l5eg,N/A

My 7 year old has been online schooling for 14 months and it looks like he won’t go back till the next school year in August. He uses an iPad for his online classes 8-1.40 and he also has kids messenger and Roblox installed on it (with restrictions so no one can chat with him etc). He is allowed a couple of hours to play or watch kids Netflix after school in the afternoon and when that ends I use the screen time control on the iPad to block all iPad access till the next  day. My problem is him getting bored in class and opening kids messenger or Roblox during class time even though he knows the rules are no electronics tillo school ends and even then only with permission. Once I found him up at night watching Netflix which is why the screen control controls are now on.

is there a parental control app that can block app access during school hours? The teachers have said they don’t want parents with them during class time and I don’t want to delete apps entirely because it’s how he plays with friends -they call each other through kids messenger then play same game on Roblox . I’m getting frustrated because I’ll walk in and see him desperately trying to close them before I notice which obviously isn’t ok. But equally I recognize that it’s been a terrible year for him and people still arent hanging out in person so he’s been very isolated And they Are his main form of communication. He also uses kids messenger to send message to my parents and my in laws as they live very far away.

any one have any thoughts? Or should I skip the app and just delete the apps on the grounds they causing him to break the rules. Once online school is over I will be able to withhold the tablet entirely if I don’t want him using it But i can’t now.

It’s nice to believe that children will be responsible and it’s great when they step up but a puppy takes a lot of work. Depending on its age, you’ll have to toilet train it (imagine a baby who can bark and walk but not contain their bladder) and crate train it and then do obedience classes. This is all in order to have a happy, healthy, well trained adult dog. Only be ready to commit to a puppy if you and your husband are ready to assume all of the responsibilities (even though it sounds like your children are awesome and will try to help). 

Also, depending on the breed, you’re looking at a lifetime commitment to an animal. So 10 years give or take. Are you ready for that? It’s not fair to bring an animal home and then return them after a period of time because it didn’t turn out the way you expected. 

If not a puppy, consider perhaps adopting a 1-2 year old dog. Many rescues will start the obedience training and work with families to match them with the right kind of dog who matches their lifestyle. They will also provide counselling to make sure you know what kind of commitment and investment you’re getting yourself into.",gjetexa,N/A

Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/jaeoyd/our_child_9_wants_to_change_their_pronouns/,Our child (9) wants to change their pronouns,kultcher,2020-10-13,1602599846.0,8,"Our child (9) wants to change their pronouns
Our child (9, born female, going to use they/them pronouns here) wrote us a note last night saying that they'd like to be referred to using He/Him pronouns.

My wife and I are both fine with this, but it's clear this was something directed at their teacher as well. It was late last night, so we told them we'd have to have a more in-depth discussion tomorrow (not because it's anything bad, just because it's a big decision).

We're mostly just looking for feedback from other parents who've dealt with similar situations. In particular, if they decide to make the change official, any advice on brokering that change with their teachers and peers.

A few notes that may be relevant:

\- Our child is curious about sex and has already identified as bi-sexual and is somewhat invested in that identity, but they've never mentioned being trans or feelings of dysphoria. We've bought them a couple of kid-friendly books that discuss topics of sex, gender and sexual orientation  
\- We've had some indications that they might be starting puberty, this was maybe two weeks ago... last we knew they were excited to be trying out training bras  
\- They've often self-identified as a ""tomboy,"" though they don't necessarily fit the stereotype (no sports, mostly an indoor kid). They mostly are into video games (Roblox) and YouTube, but still very recently were into LOL dolls and such as well. Recently expressed an interest in wearing more boy-ish clothes, though  
\- They did have a therapist until fairly recently, did not respond well to online-only visits so we discontinued them. Behaviorally, they are quick to anger and struggle to communicate at times

With all that in mind, we're aware this could be ""just a phase"" but of course we want to handle it delicately and supportively. We'll always have their back, but one of my major concerns is how it'll go over with their peers. We live in a relatively progressive, but still very rural area in the northeast US. Our child is definitely shy and sensitive and their best friend moved to a different district last year, so they've been feeling isolated and lonely even more than usual for pandemic-times.

Any advice or experiences are welcome. Thanks!",N/A,N/A

Talk to their teachers about your decision to respect their wishes so that everyone is on the same page, and request that reasonable accommodations be made with appropriate boundaries.

Born a female, they decided when they were 11 that they were a male. My sister and her husband told them that while they respected their feelings, and would use their preferred pronouns at home, it was a big decision to make and “let’s take it slow and do this right.” So parents said after one year of educating them with books, movies, etc about gender identity, the family would sit down and talk about it again. They spent the next year joining transgender forums, reading books, and speaking with a therapist. One year later the family reconvened and they said, “I would like you to call me he/him.” And now he is. And the family adjusted well. But that year gave him all the knowledge he could be equipped with to explain to anyone who didn’t understand his change.

I have another cousin they thought they were a trans boy got so far as hormones and stopped early when they realized being in the middle was better for them. Also another cousin that just comes out with a new identity every week for attention, she would make up a lot of things for attention it’s a pattern in her life since she was little. Everyone was bored of it. The family doesn’t care about orientation in the best way possible. She mellowed out after puberty and now she’s a glamorous young woman, 

so... all this to say you know your kid. In my experience with my family respect them but don’t push or encourage anything. Let them know they can always can back out and that women/men can do whatever they want eg. Girls can be rough and tough and guys can be nurturing and gentle.

No, that is not how this works. That's not how any of this works. [**This article**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/opinion/transgender-children-medical-bills.html) has a pretty good overview of why. [**Psychology Today has one too**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/202008/three-popular-myths-about-transgender-youth). Among other things, reconstructive surgery is not an option until the patient is in their late teens or early 20's. This is surgery that works best on a body that is already fully grown.

Transition is absolutely necessary to keep many trans kids alive. Without transition a hell of a lot of them commit suicide. When able to transition rates of suicide attempts drop to the national average. This is very literally life saving medical care. 

The *""90% desist""* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth. The [**American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines**](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) for the treatment of trans and GNC youth cover the origins of this myth, why it has been debunked, and what the actual best treatment is.

For preadolescents transition is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is 100% temporary puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will ""desist"" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.

Any competent doctor with a basic grasp of this topic should recognize that transition is vitally necessary, frequently life saving medical care for trans adolescence. And that if there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure.

According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/), but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes the gender expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The genders of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156). That said, many trans people also don't express their gender until much older. This is a difficult situation to articulate, and most children aren't given the language or tools with which to articulate what they're experiencing. Between this and the intense social pressure to be cis, many aren't able to verbalize their identity until they are older.

Regarding treatment for trans youth, [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines from the AAP. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender, and some of those young kids are trans. A child who is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their appearance can suffer debilitating distress over this conflict.

When this happens transition is the treatment recommended by every major medical authority. For young children this process is purely social; it consists of allowing the child to express their gender identity as comes naturally to them. If they just have gender atypical interests or clothing preferences, let them have the toys and clothes they want. If they want to use a name or pronouns atypical to the gender they were previously assumed to be, let them do that too. If they later decide they don't want to do this anymore, nothing has been changed that can't be changed back in an afternoon. Let the child explore their gender, there's no reason not to.

For adolescents, the first line of medical intervention is puberty delaying treatment. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes. This treatment is very safe and well known, because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in children who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young. If an adolescent starts this treatment then realizes medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off. There are no permanent effects, and it significantly improves trans youth's mental health and [**lowers suicidality**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/01/21/peds.2019-1725).

But if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest. 

This specter of little kids being pressured into transition and rapidly pushed into permanent physical changes is a complete myth. It just isn't happening. And this fear-mongering results in nothing except trans youth who desperately do need to transition being discouraged and prevented from doing so. Withholding medical treatment from an adolescent who desperately needs it is not a neutral option.

The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/#.pqspdcee0). When prevented from transitioning about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)

Transition [**vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts**](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2), and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets. The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the [**largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/).

Regarding chances of ""transition regret"", this incredibly rare. It is vastly more common for trans people to regret *not* being able to start transition-related treatment in adolescence, sparing them the trauma and damage of being forced through an inappropriate puberty, than it is for people to transition as adolescents and later regret it.

Of everyone who starts transition, event eh most preliminary stages of trying a new name or pronouns, only about 8% of detransition, and of those who do 62% go on to transition again later - meaning only 3% detransiton permanently. And among those who do detransition, nearly all cited external factors as their reasons for doing - e.g., intolerable levels of anti-trans harassment or discrimination (31%), employment discrimination (29%), and pressure from a parent (36%), spouse (18%), or other family members (26%).

I will say this: you child obviously trusts you. They are talking to you about their gender and sexuality, which means you have created an environment where they are comfortable being themself. Kudos for that!
I’d say, let them take the lead. Let them dress how they want, let them use the pronouns they want, but also let them know that you are here to support their experimentation with gender, and that you will also be happy to switch pronouns again if they find he/him pronouns don’t fit them. 
One final note, 9 is a bit young for an AFAB trans or non-binary person to come out. This is because AFAB people aren’t pushed into gender boxes as much as AMAB people are, so until puberty (11-14) they don’t usually experience a lot of dysphoria or discomfort. I would visit a doctor and find exactly how far along your child’s puberty is. I went through puberty at 9 years old as well, and it was so hard to be feeling with body hair and pads while my friends were playing with barbies. My early puberty actually left me disabled, with a back fracture. 
You can ask your child and your pediatrician about puberty blockers, even for just a few years, so your child can have a chance to explore and be a kid.

Where I am the ""treatment"" for those who want it is hormone blockers which just literally stop you from having puberty so you stay basically completely androgynous (if you started early enough) and then if you stop taking them one day you will go through puberty just as you would have before if you never took them and nothing has changed long term. It's just a delay to give a child time to figure things out.

Puberty delaying treatment is entirely temporary and very well studied, because it has been used for decades to delay development in children who would otherwise have started it inappropriately young.

Most children with precocious puberty don't have any underlying medical condition, their early development is just an extreme variation of normal puberty. But it would still fuck them up to start puberty at the age of, say, 6. So they're put on blockers for a few years to delay it. When they stop treatment, puberty picks up where it left off.

This treatment is entirely temporary and has no permanent effects. It just puts puberty on hold. If an adolescent starts this treatment, then realizes that medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off.

But if an adolescent starts this treatment, and *is* trans, having received this treatment means they are spared the physical and psychological harm being forced through the wrong puberty would have subjected them to. They can stay on blockers until they are in their mid-teens, and if by that point they still identify strongly as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth the chances that they will change their minds later is close to zero. At that point hormone therapy (estrogen or testosterone supplements) become an option.",g8qausq,g8q1y4j

UPDATE: Thanks you to everyone who responded and gave their advice and shared their experience. Also thanks for reassuring me that I’m not the worst dad on earth! Lol



So to keep this short and sweet I’ll try and get to the point quickly. Due to the stay at home order, my wife, two sons and I are at home all day everyday. I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m not suited to be a stay at home dad, daycare teacher, TA or what ever the hell the school system expects of me. It’s not totally because I don’t want to spend hrs reading, doing basic math, planning activities, arts and crafts. But that’s most of the reason. Not to mention our kindergartener isn’t interested either. He fights and resist anything that isn’t roblox. 

He and is brother(almost 2yrs old) are really lacking in multiple areas. Their diets are awful, well really my baby boy’s. He only wants to eat chocolate chip muffins everyday all day. Ironically, my 5 yr old only eats all the tangerines like he’s in a competition. I mean chaining em folks. Not my 1 yr old. No fruits, veggies, or real meals. He likes chicken and bananas but it’s like pulling teeth to get him to choose those over snacks. He also wants to guzzle juice all day. I always try and give him water mixed in to dilute it. 

They both don’t care about hygiene. I have to force them both to brush their teeth. My 1 yr old only wants to chew on the brush and suck off the paste. My 5 year old doesn’t want to brush at all and acts like you’re trying to murder him if you so much as wipe his face, comb/brush his hair, anything hygienic. I’m really into barbering and want to start school when all of this is over, but I can’t even practice on them in the meantime because they won’t sit still and act terrified of the clippers. My 5 yr old could use a nice wash n condition but, again, he literally has a nervous breakdown when I attempt to wash him up in anyway. I think he may actually be on the spectrum. But that’s a thread for another day.

So in conclusion, I’m a awful father. If anyone has any advice and guidance on what I can do to improve I’m open to any and all suggestions. 

Thanks for reading! 

TLDR I feel like a negligent, bad parent because my kids aren’t doing what they should be doing academically, eat poorly and have poor hygiene/self care.",N/A,N/A

Instead, maybe write down all the things that you perceive are going badly and pick one snall thing to change at a time. For instance, improving one aspect of the family routine or one child's eating habits. You cannot change everything at once. Persist with that change and if it becomes established, pick another goal.

I can definitely relate, in fact I made a post about it on here. The school systems are shoving curriculum down everyone's throat, the kids and adults alike are going stir crazy because nobody is used to being shut in for such a period of time, and without school and play time the kids have more energy than ever. It doesn't make you a bad father, but it is an adjustment that needs to be made.

I'm not preaching by any means because I'm not there either lol. I'll be damned if my kid gets any school work done through the week because I'm working still, and her mom won't follow through with school work. 

My best advice is to set up a specific schedule, and if you are available during the hours the kids are usually in school it works. Their little brains are programmed to be learning during that time. Don't overload them though because you aren't a teacher, you don't get paid to teach. Do what you can, and what they can.

I set alarms when its time for school work. Like one alarm at 10am and we do like an hour and a half. Then at like 2pm do another hour and a half. Honestly we both give up early almost every day, but I'm not a teacher lol. 

If I said a lot of kids were eating proper balanced healthy diets I'd be full of it. I wouldn't stress too much about that. They do gotta eat, and when they can eat healthy its good, but as long as they're eating something. (A helpful tip i learned on here is get a sticker of their favorite character and put it on the box. I tried it, and it works like a charm) just imagine batman chicken thighs lol.

Lastly, brushing of teeth is probably the most important thing you mentioned lol. Electric toothbrushes are entertaining for them, and tasty toothpaste just makes them want to eat it. (But they're eating lol) in all honesty nobody is giving their kids a daily bath, and all that while they're just sitting at home.

You can talk about general rules eg in every home, children brush their teeth. That’s also what we’ll do here. Make it universal vs personal and confrontational. 

My kid at around 6-7 took the habit of hiding candy under his pillow to munch on it after bedtime. Guess what, he had 6 cavities in his baby teeth, to fix. The truth is, as parents we need to supervise hygiene well into teenage years. 

About the nutrition part, I’d also be a bit rigid. Chocolate muffins? Out! An acquaintance of mine used to give watered down baby formula to their 6yo child throughout the night, from a baby bottle.

Mine are 3 and 5. What I've done about eating is having structured meals and mealtimes. They have only two glasses of juice a day (one at breakfast and one in the afternoon), sweets only at afternoon snack time, and even then it's usually one tiny chocolate egg. This more rigid structure came about because they were avoiding the real foods in order to have snacks later...

To encourage them to drink water, I fill them each a bottle of water in the morning (like a sports bottle, bonus points for being their favourite colour or having pictures of dinosaurs) and leave it where they can easily reach. (To avoid the excess juice that happened in the beginning.)

For toothbrushing, what worked for us is putting a 2.5 minute long toothbrushing song on YouTube while we brush their teeth. My husband brushes one while I brush the other kid's teeth. The older the kids is, the more time they get to brush their own teeth.

But most importantly, give yourself a break. You're all cooped up together in a stressful situation. It might be better to let some things go. Teaching them can be done at a slower pace, spread out the crafts and activities and make them simple...

We drink smoothies many mornings, and I'll add spinach/kale, coconut milk, a nut butter, half a grated carrrot in with berries. The greens and carrot are disguised, so my kiddo doesn't mind.

Keep in mind that this is not home schooling.  This is ""crisis"" schooling.  We are getting all different kinds of stuff from our schools, and a lot of it is simply not developmentally appropriate for young kids.  The schools are trying.  We're trying.  It's no one's fault.  It's just crappy.

My daughter C is almost 12 and I do not like her “best friend” J. They have been on again off again friends for 3 years and go to different schools now so mostly they only talk on the phone and play online games together with 3 boys that were in their 4th grade class together. Occasionally I will allow her to spend the weekend over there but J is not allowed to stay at our house.

She started out okay and spent the night with us one time where she called her mom in the middle of the night and left without telling me. My daughter C came to my room crying and said J left, I called her Mom and she said J watched something scary and wanted to come home. Ok cool just let me know next time. We tried again and when her mom picked her up she asked her if she had her things together and this girl tells her mom to go do it, and her mom does!!!!! Like wtf, I get spoiling a child but taking orders no ma’am. So this ended the sleepovers at our house but C still went over there occasionally and when she got home would be loud and obnoxious and demanding like J is at her house, we moved @30 min away so they saw less of each other and it was no big deal. 

Once we moved J started making C feel bad and would hold their friendship over her head and make her feel bad about making friends at her new school. I told C this is not friendship and she should stop talking to her. C did pull away but J started telling her she was going to hurt herself, she would come to me in tears not knowing what to do so we told her mom what was going on and I told C it was time for a break.

She erased her number and stopped talking to her for a few months, she randomly started calling C again and would be friendly and tell her she changed and they would get their group together again to play Roblox but J always started either making C feel bad about herself or causing issues with the other kids in the group. 

She is bossy and the last time C stayed with her she forced her to stay up all night when they knew they were going to a theme park the next day then made everyone miserable all day by being a spoiled brat and arguing all day to get what she wanted, it was so bad they came home early. 

C comes to me tonight asking me to text J’s mom because she sent her pictures of her arms and scissors and said she was cutting herself. The cuts were superficial and most likely for attention because she wasn’t getting her way and because C and one of the boys said they were “going out”. I text her mom and she sounds like she is dealing with it but I don’t think C should be subjected to this and want them to stop talking. 

How do I tell her to stop talking to her without breaking her heart or making her think I want to dictate her friends. I feel bad for not liking this girl but in the end it is my job to protect my daughter and I listen to too much true crime to not trust my gut about her. Sheila Eddy and Rachael Shoaf anyone? 

This is not everything of course but I am just looking for insight, has anyone else dealt with this? What did you do? My heart says block her from C’s phone and tell her sorry I’m the Mom but I am not sure if that would make her want to be sneaky behind my back.

I have an 8yo daughter with some issues. Today we got a call from the school principal saying that ""Tia"" was on the playground during recess swinging on the swing set. There was a girl swinging next to her, same grade different class. The girl was telling Tia how her dog had died last night. My kind, sensitive and filled with empathy daughter says to the mourning little girl, ""why don't you get a gun and kill yourself.""

WTF? Seriously. I don't know where this comes from, (well I possibly do, probably the internet?) but her mother and I NEVER speak like that.  And she LOVES animals (no she's not abusing them) which makes it all the stranger. 

This is pretty out there and extreme but, my question is: Tia has two rats that she truly loves. In order to teach her some empathy, I was thinking about either telling her in the car on the way home from school that her rats had died. Or just not saying anything at all on the way home, put the rats up at a friends house, and either telling her they died or not really saying anything at all just telling her they're gone and that's it. Or legitimately giving her pets away as punishment.

I don't like the idea of lying to her, we try to stress the importance of being truthful. Would the shock hurt her more than it would help her,""

I am not his mom obviously but was in his life since he was 2.  We had a good relationships until recently. He has recently become super difficult to manage, only with us (me and his dad).  He used to respond, albeit slowly, to positive reinforcement and time outs.  However now he will scream and throw a tantrum if you tell him something as minor as “time out because you hit the cat” or “time to take a bath” (we even tried giving him warnings so he wasn’t caught unaware) and will immediately follow it up with “I am just going to go to my moms house”.

He said it multiple times a day, every day for about 4 days straight and also throws in things like “I already stayed here a long time I need to go back to mom” “why don’t you ever take us places anymore” (his mom still takes them out but we are following the state stay at home
orders) and “my moms is better because she got me a lot of toys there.”  He has tons of toys here, a tablet, and projects, along with a bike and a park where he plays with other kids so it’s not like we are just boring?

Like we literally asked him to put his shoes on because we were going out and he got mad cuz he wanted to stay home and play roblox and said he wants to go back to his moms???

my partner just ignores it, but it drives me nuts because 1) i interpret it as he doesn’t want to be here when he says it that often and 2) it’s just a terrible response to rules/structure that I am concerned is becoming a habit.

Additional things:

1) we are going thru a custody battle to get primary custody for various reasons, one of which is that their mom arbitrarily restricted parenting time to 4 days a month for the last three months over money reasons.  However his mom has apparently been telling him that we are the ones trying to keep him from her.


2) his mom focuses on totally different things than us - eg, we encourage him to wipe his own butt and do things for himself, brush his teeth/change before he starts playing, restrict his device time.  His mom thinks he is a baby still so does everything for him and has more freedom with his devices (eg, he is allowed to go on roblox or watch youtube for hours).  

3) his mom has a tendency to bribe her kids with toys and vacations

I don’t know if these things are the cause or what, but I am losing my cool and I don’t want to.

My partner and I have an (informal) shared custody of his 2 kids (11m, 10f). We’re in a pretty good place now with his ex, but when the details were still being ironed out years ago it was very difficult for all involved. Their bio mum was very much in the ‘but I’m their MOTHER’ camp and therefore didn’t want us to have any regular overnights with them unless it suited her so it took a long time to break that mentality. That had a huge impact on the kids and their behaviour with us because of the type of conversations they were overhearing with her. My advice to you and your SO would be to constantly remind your SS that there is nothing he can say or do to make you not love him or not want to see him. When children feel they aren’t emotionally ‘safe’ (ie he will be aware the custody issues are happening) they want to test to see who they can trust. I would also empathise with him about how difficult this all must be for him. That doesn’t mean ignore the hurtful things he says, but more temper them with love and empathy. So if he says he wants to go back to his mum’s, perhaps a response could be ‘it must be so tricky for you at the moment feeling like you don’t know where you want to be. It makes me feel sad when you say you aren’t happy here, but know that there’s nothing you can say or do that would make me not want you here.’",giksai3,N/A

I think the thing to always remember with kids is that most anger/rudeness/aggression they may display can often be underpinned by feeling scared or anxious or sad.

EDIT UPDATE: Thank you all for the many suggestions! I bought a bunch of the books you all recommended on Amazon and he said some of them looked ok, which for an 8-year-old boy is a glowing review. I had NO CLUE there were Minecraft and Pokemon books. Once we got them they did seem a little...big...for him but hey, he can always grow into it. He recently did his reading level placement test and is at just above a 4th-grade level. He can totally read and do it well but he is SO self-conscious about it. The only way I could get him to read the short stories for the assessment was to print them and he could go read them alone in his room. He absolutely did read them because he was answering the comprehension questions beautifully. He also reads video games with zero issues. I wish I could boost his confidence more, maybe having some ""cool"" ""big kid"" books will help. He even picked some Goosebumps books out, which surprised me big time because he gets scared easily. Thanks again!!

My son is 8, he was a late reader not really catching on until age 6-7. He still has some trouble with fluency and can get stuck on words occasionally. Overall though he has done really well during the last year and can read those step books up through the biggest ones and only stumbles a few times. He doesn't like to read at all and teaching him has been really stressful, he is just a super-sensitive kind of kid and he is really afraid of reading things wrong or not knowing or not doing it perfectly so he won't even try (hello my clone!). I have been trying so hard to give him encouragement and emphasize it doesn't matter if he says it wrong and he will never be yelled at or make me mad by not knowing what a word is.

I want him to begin to read some chapter books but I really don't know where to begin honestly. He isn't into much besides video games (pokemon, Minecraft, roblox, etc.) so I'm not sure what stories are even out there that are popular with kids anymore. I was a babysitters club kind of girl and I could pick what I like but I don't know what he might enjoy. I have tried to get him to look at books online with me and pick some stories but he is super disinterested.

What books or series do your kids like? I was thinking of a chapter book that's an easy intro where he could read a few pages a day. I would love to take him into the library or the cute little bookstore we have in town to pick something but...pandemic and my city is full of the inconsiderate jerk types who don't believe coronavirus exists. We have to stick to online only right now.",N/A,N/A

This way he hears the words and sees them simultaneously, but is not responsible for sounding them out without a model. You could do small chunks (a paragraph maybe) with the audio and then pause the audio so he can read that same paragraph over again, aloud and on his own. I recommend the audiobook method as kids get older rather than you reading and him parroting (though that works as well) because it has a little more of the ""cool"" and ""grownup"" factor and feels less like ""I'm a baby being read to.""",g19zf51,N/A

One of my kids was about that age when he started early chapter books because he was a slow developer... He was my foster child first. Humphrey's Tiny Tales are a nice step up from level 3s. They're about a classroom hamster from his point of view, the font is large, the chapters are short, it has some pictures. If he loves them, he can graduate to the original Humphrey books. Judy Moody and Stink Moody are the boy/girl sibling pair that each have a series of books. They also have illustrations, short chapters, easy vocab. I think Stink is supposed to be 7 or 8. Marvin Redpost is a series about a young boy about 8, they're short and simple and written by Louis Sacher, who wrote Wayside School and Holes.

He is so self-conscious about reading and I am just at a loss on how to help him. He absolutely CAN read. He did his yearly reading assessment and he scored at a grade level of 4.3 and he is starting 3rd grade this year. He did really well with the comprehension questions and honestly, the ones he got wrong weren't absolutely way out in the left field. He was choosing those ""runner up answers"" is how I think of them, the ones that are close but not quite right. So I know he is reading it and understanding. 

Yet when I pull up a short story and ask him to read it, either in his head or out loud, he just shuts right down. Immediately begins crying and shuts off completely. I've been SO conscious of never, ever, scolding him for getting words wrong or taking too long or anything like that. I've tried to be as positive as humanly possible and encourage trying even if he doesn't know for sure. I frame failure as no big deal because that is how we learn etc. but he is just so averse to reading. I don't force it or push it, I don't want to create any sort of negative association with it but I'm not sure how to help either. I don't know why he reacts this way and it's not just with me. It's with anybody at all who tries to get him to read. Yet, I can print the stories out for him and he will read them alone in his room. Then he can come back and answer the questions no problem.

It might be easier just to start infusing silliness and play into your every day routines.  For example, when cooking together or eating, we may pretend we are at a restaurant, or royalty, or part of beauty and the beast and start using different voices/taking each others orders, ecetera.  It isn't really planned, just playing around. Play can just be building upon your relationship with each other. 

We have the same overabundance of toys in our house but I have read that less is more in that department.  Pre close by grandparents, we had less toys and the kids actually played much better.

Then, she’s been really into soap cutting ASMR, so I took two nice expensive soaps I’ve been saving for... whatever... and showed her how to slice off little curls. Then we put it into a double boiler, added some shimmer pigment, stirred it up, and made mini soap balls. That was relaxing too, plus the soap was lavender scented, so extra sensory bonus. Plus our hands were super clean afterwards.

Take a simple example. I am not by any means a brilliant playful parent, but I'm proud of this one. When the whole covid-19 thing began, my son needed to wash hands regularly. But he didn't want to use hand sanitizer much less soap dispensers. My girlfriend would butt heads with him multiple times a day about it. ""You have to"", ""There is a virus out there"", ""It's not enough to simply rinse your hands"", etc. The more you pressured the little dude, the more stubborn and unwilling he became.

That is until the dispensers started making fart noises. ""I'm sure I've fixed it. It definitely won't make a farting noise now. There is just NO WAY. Dad has made it so it's completely quiet. Try it"". He pushed it and goes: ""Pffffrt!!!"", While laughing hysterically.

We did it 3 times, and now it's never an issue to use dispensers. I made up a similar game for applying sunscreen.",fvbff08,fvbe8cb

My son is still very young, but I find I've somehow gravitated to making a lot of ""discipline"" a game. Like ""don't climb the stairs! I'll pick you up and get you down"". But then he goes again, and I pick him up again and put him down, and then he gets this twinkle in his eye and before I know it I'm like ""too-tee-doo I'm an innocent Mommy walking ar- what is that? No, my baby wouldn't climb the stairs. He wouldn't. He... what is he doing? Noooooooooooo the pick-up monster is taking over..."" and so on, and it's a total blast for both of us. And to my surprise he actually reduced the behavior. Or at least would try and catch my eye before he did it.

I'm a bit tongue-in-cheek when I describe Cohen's book because, well, it's kind of like that... It's not explicit ""this will solve all your problems"", parenting books usually aren't but then you get to the 50th example of the One Trick solving a new completely unrelated problem and you start being like ""really? this solved that too?""... Plenty of parenting books do that so it's not a strike against this one specifically. But even if I don't want to over-interpret its claims I did find it very interesting and valuable and I think its message that play solves a lot more problems than you'd think is probably 100% correct.",fvbgdeo,fvbff08

I had this talk with another reddit user. Parenting books are by and large absolute garbage. There are a few good ones in the bunch, and I think the one you mention is one of them, but then it goes too far and tries to use the same hammer for every problem.

I like the Yale course Everyday Parenting: The ABCs of Child Rearing, because it'd actually realistic, down to earth, and acknowledges that you will probably only get compliance from your kid 80% of the time.

Another issue with parenting advice, is the kind of advice made by professionals with a theoretical background, who clearly don't have kids themselves. You know the kind. They give advice on how to stop tantrums, but fail to acknowledge or take into account how exhausted most parents probably are, when attempting to apply their advice.

I remember reading a blog from a young child psychologist, who wrote that it's super simple to teach a toddler what not to touch. ""You simply say no in a calm voice, and remove them from the object of interest"". Yeah. Simple as fuck. Now try doing it 200 times in a row, on 2 hours of sleep, with vomit on your pants, and while you're hurrying to a doctor's appointment. It's not that the advice is wrong, it's just that people really need to take into account the emotional state of the parent.",fvbh883,fvbgdeo

My son turns 10 on Sunday.   
His brother turned 7 yesterday.  


All week the (almost) 10 year old has been very wildly emotional. Normally he's quite the sensitive kid, but this week it's been crying when I ask what he wants for his birthday, crying when his caeser salad at the restuarant came with bacon on it - and after I removed the bacon the salad was ""too warm"", running off and curling into a ball this morning when the cereal ran out as he was pouring it into his bowl, etc.  
And he goes from one right to the other. He went from being crying, real tears down face, emotional crying, to huge big smile when I showed him some pokemon stuff.   


**is this part of puberty, these mood swings? is almost 10 normal for puberty to start?**  


I am used to him being emotional as that's who he is (gets that from me), but this is a whole other level.   


Nothing has changed home wise, school wise, friends wise. He's been in the same camp for 6 weeks now and loves going, we've had the same parenting schedule for nearly 4 years. Dad and I have both been with the same partners for 3+ years.   


**Is this just puberty with a boy? Am I just to expect him to have mood swings for a little while?**  


**Also - those with 10+ year old boys** \- Son loves farming simulator, [beam.ng](https://beam.ng) (driving game) and roblox. He doesn't want any video games for his birthday, doesn't want lego, doesn't want anything.   
I'm lost. I got him a one piece PJ that is a red panda (his bro also got one and when bro opened it he said he wanted one - so phew, I did something right), and some robux.. **What do you buy a kid who wants nothing, but still makes him feel special?** He has a hiking backpack and hiking boots, he has a bike, has a scooter, has his own computer..   


We're taking them maybe Monday to go to this place in Vancouver with suspension bridges and all sorts of fun stuff as part of our yearly ""doing"" present.  We generally buy them 3 smaller gifts and then spend a day where we all go do something different than we'd normally do on our weekends to make some memories with them. last year was boating with their uncle, the year before was a trip to the big waterpark  - which I;m trying to arrange for a sunday the year but it keeps calling for rain on sundays \*hrumf\*",N/A,N/A

Hello! My nephew lives with my dad and me (i’m 33f). Just for context, my dad and I are both progressive. We practice inclusivity, loving kindness, standing up for others when something’s wrong, etc etc. 

With COVID19 and online schooling, my nephew spends a ton of time on roblox and discord. Recently, my sister (who was just visiting) walked in on him with a nazi meme on the screen and I thought it must be a one off. Then it happened again that same week, only I was the one to walk in on him with an eagle holding a swastika on the screen. I said, “what is that?” And he said, “it’s an eagle”—completely ignoring the massive swastika in its talons!! I was stunned.

My dad talked to him first but didn’t get much out of him about it. My sister, dad and I ended up talking to him together, and he said it was “not a big deal” and “just a joke.” Then, he said he “didn’t know what it meant”— it, as in the swastika. These responses did not make me feel better about this situation at all. Also, my nephew very well did know the meaning, as our family spent an afternoon visiting the local Holocaust Museum just three months earlier. 

I’m aware radicalization can happen in online gamer circles. I’m not saying he’s necessarily at a dangerous point—I don’t know rn—but I am definitely concerned. Have any of you had a similar experience? If so, how did you handle it? Any ideas of how to move forward without cutting him off his games? (He mainly plays what appears to be a benign car racing game). I’m glad he has a way to connect socially while we are staying safe at home, but I don’t want it to compromise his values in the end.

4. Just because someone posts a joke does not mean they believe it. I know plenty of kind and genuine people who joke about stuff like that all the time, its how this generation copes

I have a little boy who recently turned 5 and also has adhd. His newest obsession is the phone. He uses my old galaxy, in kids mode and plays roblox and some other stuff Ive put on there for him. I always keep it on kids mode so he can't get into things he shouldn't. So, anyway, his birthday was last month and I thought it would be fun to go onto my Walmart app & look through some toys and stuff to pick out things he might want. I added it to kids mode and forgot to take it off. I saw him looking at it a few times and was like ""ehh how much harm could he cause? I'll take it off tomorrow.""

Well this morning I was bored at work, so i decided to clean out my emails. I get walmart emails all the time and it's usually just ads for different crap, so I ignore them. One caught my eye from last week, though. My order didn't go through, I needed to add a different card or call customer service. Hmmm. I didn't order anything.  Must be a mistake. 

I go into my cart and take a look. My sweet, intelligent, beautiful, wonderful child, who just learned to spell his own name and still doesn't know his own middle name, has added and attempted to purchase over $200 worth of toys. A ride on lightning McQueen toy, a huge hotwheels track, a few remote control cars, a crib(for his new baby sister that's due in march, I assume) & a few other random things. I never added my new bank card to my account because I haven't ordered anything since I got it and the card on there is from a bank account I no longer have. I have been meaning to add it, but I'm a procrastinator. I will be removing the walmart app from kids mode as soon as I get home. ",N/A,N/A

He just responded well to it and its hard to get him to pay attention to anything he's not interested in, nevermind retaining any of what he's being shown or taught in school or by me. Through the phone, I was able to get him to learn his birthday, his numbers, he was doing 100% better on writing his letters because I put an app on it that allowed him to trace letters and words and he was able to replicate it on paper. He was learning all kinds of interesting things and watching shows about science and wanting to do experiments and just all this stuff that had been so hard to get him to do before. However, my son doesn't do anything halfway. He obsesses over things, so he only wants to play on the phone now. He doesn't want to do literally anything else. And he's not doing the educational stuff anymore, he only wants to play roblox. He will do the educational stuff only because I make him before he's allowed to open roblox. I'm so sick and tired of the damn phone, I want to run it over with my car. I try to keep him limited to an hour a day, and he can earn or lose 10 minute blocks of time, but he constantly asks for it and argues and fights and cries and it's just exhausting.

Otherwise it might be that when he gets out in his own (college) he won't know how to establish a new routine in the new circumstances and flounder. Thats part of my story.

It's interesting because I see a lot of the behaviors and traits that led to his diagnosis, in myself. I have always had the misconception that a kid with adhd was just a loud, hyper, fast talking  crazy kid and that's not my son at all. He's not hyper, he's just really impulsive and doesn't seem to be able to connect actions with consequences, as well as a bunch of other things.

Lots of great advice there. (and lots of people just wanting to commiserate in some misery, but this is the internet xD)

There is a good possibility you too are ADHD. it has definite genetic markers and is almost certainly hereditary.  If you have the time you might consider seeing a professional and at least getting assessed for it, if not diagnosed officially. Knowing you have some of the same brain function difficulties and seeing how you learn to deal with it can really help for teaching such things to your kid.

Also, Definitely: The concept of ADHD Kids being totally off the wall and disruptive is only half of the diagnosis. There is also the Primary Initiative type, which tend to be very withdrawn and inward looking, but flighty in mind if not physical activity. They jump from topic to topic in their head to get the necessary stimulus rather than physically jumping to get it.  That Hyperactive side is also what leads to a lot of missed diagnosis among kids, especially smart ones. It is very common to hear 'No, you do too well in school to have ADHD'.... which is a load of crock. I was top 5% of my class in highschool, NHS, and well regarded as going to go far (even went to college early, graduating from HS a full semester ahead).

I then flunked out of college hard cause all the structure from my family life was gone. And I had no idea how to make my own cause no one knew I was ADHD, and I had never learned to do it.

For Advice: Immediate feedback is the best. You cannot give 'Do this for a week and you'll get a reward' type with an ADHD. A week? Who cares that's so far away. It won't ever come. Reward structures with kids with ADHD need to be fast and immediate upon good actions.  Something like: Every time you do this thing you get a star on your chart. You can do the 10 stars and its a reward thing if you want, but the real feedback is the important star that you get immediately, right away. And the fact that its now visible proof of reward sitting on that chart, forever easy to see.

Its why video games are so interesting to ADHD. They work on the concept of an immediate feedback loop, as I mentioned before. Hit the stick to the right. Player moves to the right. This is a new learned aspect. Hit the jump button. Immediate response. Oooh this is good it is immediate and it continues to change slightly every time - its never the exact same so I don't get super bored!

Attention Deficit is often said to be a really bad way to way to describe ADHD. Its not that we lack attention. its that EVERYTHING grabs our attention for small moments. What is a better way is that our Executive Control Functions - the part of your brain that you use to consciously make decisions about what to do does not work very well. It is constantly looking for the next stimulus, and if something is boring or not fun it is discarded by your brain as not important. Because THIS is here. Or THAT is here. And THISTHAT is over there! Oooh look at this!

And through everything, the most important thing to remember is: He really is trying. It won't necessary seem like it some time (Take out the trash! (while playing a video game) okay mom! ... 6 hours later still playing the game and trash is not taken out...)  but with Executive impairments there really is a difficulty in making that decision to go do the chore.  The brain just doesn't have the right function to adjust from one task to another 


Heh. Obviously, I could talk for hours on this. Ill leave it at that, but am willing to answer any questions to the best of my ability (though I Am Not A Doctor, so take any advice with a grain of salt as it is presented through my own lens of personal experiences) and of course, the links provided above are good resources.",eb8qa1w,eb8of9d

Narrator: It was not fun.

I was the “potential” girl. Teachers constantly “tsked” and said, “But you have so much potential!” Yes, very helpful.

Things that help me:

Knowing I’m different but not bad. Just knowing my brain is wired a bit differently but that that comes with strengths as well as weaknesses is really helpful.

Meds. Ermahgerd meds. Strattera really helps me make the most of what ability I have to organise and time manage. I have had positive results with Adderall as well, but the negatives are more pronounced and more complicated.

Exercise. Reduces anxiety(which absolutely destroys, again, what little executive function I’ve got going) and calms me down on so many levels.

Diet. Managing blood sugar/mood is just really good all round. A healthy diet makes everything easier, a cranky, tired, moody ADHDer is one who is limited in their ability to work or study(or sometimes interact easily.)

Routine: ADHDers thrive on spontaneity and creativity- I call my brain popcorn brain because one thought pops off a dozen more only glancingly related thoughts. But I cannot do well without routine. Living by myself, without another person or external work to create routine,  eventually leaves me like a broken doll with springs sticking out of her head.

 I’ll stay up because I forget to take my sleeping pill and/or I’m excited and hyperfocused on something, then I’ll crash and not feed myself or shower, and the spiral begins. I didn’t learn this in childhood so I had to teach myself as an adult.

Visual reminders and learning: I’m still out of sight, out of mind, even though age has mellowed my ADHD considerably. (That is, I’ve learned a bunch of ways to compensate for it and make the most of it.) Color-coding, see-through drawers and cupboards, and visual chore charts and study styles (like drawing pictures of notes or making maps of the relationships of concepts) are still embarrassingly handy. Not all ADHDers are visual or kinesthetic but it’s incredibly common- I recommend having your kiddo tested for Big 5/OCEAN personality, IQ and intelligence types and learning style, minimum, to best gather information about ways to work with him as you shore up his weaknesses and maximise his strengths- like any parent does.

He sounds like a great kid, and thank goodness that card wasn’t on!!",eba6nfz,eb8of9d

I'm at my wit's end of what to do with my son's gaming outbursts, it seems to be mainly games like Minecraft (online), Fortnite, Roblox if it involves fighting or games like Tower of Hell.

He's had so many warnings, bans, I've tried being nice to him, explained it to him that I am concerned for his mental health, it also results in arguments within the household with my wife and I. 

I have a younger daughter who is complete opposite, she can play any game whatsoever but you never hear her losing her shit. 

I've just taken his controller off him again and said that he's banned from his Xbox and PC for the rest of the week.  

Academically and technical abilities are way above his peers, emotionally and socially he's lacking.

He's such a clever boy but I'm unable to reason with him, I've tried to introduce story games but he always reverts back to the same games, the games that trigger him. 

Covid makes it difficult too as we have been going as much as we can as a family, although it's always a battle to get my son out. 

No kids are currently out playing because of the lockdown either, so it's not like I can send him out to play.

And sometimes after the fact punishments do not help kids learn what to do in the moment. A highly emotional kid often is not capable of stoping his emotional tidal wave to remember that he is going to get a consequence of he rides this wave and then on top of that be able to redirect his emotions to something more acceptable all within a few seconds. So you need to help him learn what to do in the moment to handle whatever is pissing him off. 

I think you need to help him make a plan. During a non-gaming time (so not right after one of these outbursts), let him know that you are concerned about how these game affect his emotions and you want to help him make a plan on how to deal with the emotions that come with the games in the moment. Let him know that if he continues as he is now, that it will result in him losing the games and you know that that's not what he wants. One of our sons therapist talked with our highly emotional son about how his body feels prior to a meltdown and how this is the way our body let's our brain know we are about to lose our shit. Once we can recognize these cues, then we can implement whatever plan we need to help ourselves calm down during a highly emotional time. So - you need to help him learn to recogn he is getting upset in the first place and then what the plan is when he recognizes his cue. For example my son's physical cue was swaying but your son's could be anything from clenching fists, grinding teeth, flutter in chest or stomach, etc. My son's plan when he got upset was to play the game categories in his head along with deep breathing but your son's could be whatever you think he will follow through with. Practice 'the plan"" even when your son is not upset so it becomes second nature. Right before your son goes to play the game go over again the signal and the plan. His signal or cue might also be something game related like less than 10% life or something.  Don't expect this to work the first time or even the 10th as learning to control emotions when in an agitated state is difficult to learn. Tweak the plan if necessary and keep practicing in non-gaming times.",gi49zr2,N/A

We play Minecraft together and sometimes she gets lost in it for hours and hours on end but the boundary is there to be respected, if you ask your kid to put the game down and join in a family activity it should happen right away.

My wife and I found that our kids love board games when we play too, they'll never dig one out and play themselves but if we set up a game night and join in they'll lose themselves in it.

    So at 50 and having been married three times, no body ask me anything about relationship. Obviously I don’t have a clue lol. Parenting however, well, years have definitely made the difference. So I only have two children biologically but if you knew my story, you’d know that is a mere label to my grandparents, parents or within my heart or home. For me..... before I’d even consider marring a woman I consider if I’m ready to marry her children, for life, in every detail. By that I mean, as an example. Im recently discovered from, you guest it, wife # 3 and while my ( her ) boys are not biologically mine and I’m not legally or court ordered to pay child support I do regardless. Every single month I send my child support check to help raise my two boys with her. That’s just the way it is for me, and I’m the only dad they’ve ever really had. So for me, in total I have 7 children. 4 with my first wife. Our (  biological ) two twin girls and her son and daughter. Second wife, our ( her) son and 3 wife, well you already know about our two boys. So I been raising children since I was 20, boys and girls, ages now 11 through 29 and lots of mistakes early on and still do just not nearly as many, plus no one’s perfect, parents or children. 

       One thing I’ve never wavered from though, is how my children are to behave and the respect they are to show with everyone, Not just adults but siblings and other kids. There were severe penalties for not doing so and that was impressed upon all my children earlier on. 

         You and I must have the same 11 year old son lol. My son Parton takes after his mother and is extremely intelligent. We’ve already had to move him up in a grade and if things continue the way they are will more than likely have to consider doing it again next school year. However I’m against it for the very reason you mentioned with your son, Patron is already socially awkward with his peers. 

      Now, he like your son, had an obsession with his game system which he cultivated because his mother and I allowed it to happen. I,the hard ass, wouldn’t let him get away with his shenanigans. His mother, him being her baby 🙄would. Now remember, like your son, patron is very smart ( clever). He used this to his advantage and would pit us against one another, leading use to have a disagreement and he was free to go about
His game play because we were now dealing with each other. Now I was hip to this, like I said, it his old dog has been around a whole min. But to enforce any discipline was virtually impossible once she and I were not on the same page. It all came to a head when he started throwing his little butt on the floor when he didn’t get his way. There is were this old man lost it and said wife be damn, not no but hell no. His fourth to the last time he did it, I calmly sat him down and explained to him that his behavior was unacceptable and would not be tolerated anymore. The next time he did it,his game system was mine for a week. Not only that but I would rearrange his little bottom, there’d be no talking, I wasn’t going to say one word. I would snatch him up regardless of where we were or who was around, it did not matter. 

   It took three incidences to drive my point home. The last time, he, his mother and old brother were in the kitchen as she got them ready for school. I was still lingering in the bed half awake when I heard his body hit the floor and start his tantrum. I calmly got out of bed, only wearing my boxers. Walked past them though the kitchen to my sons room, yanked his PlayStation from the wall, walked back through the kitchen out the front door and threw the S.O.B in the trash. Walked back in the house in the kitchen jerked my eyes the size of saucers son of the floor and beat his ass   After which as I calmly walked away said “ you might be allowed to have another one once you’ve proven that you’re grown up enough to own one”. That was the last time my son put his but on the floor. Now I know that 80% of those reading this probably think I shouldn’t be allowed to have kids lol nor would they treat their child that way. Well, in my opinion that’s exactly why we have the problems we do with the youth today. I’m not advocating that folks abuse their children, no parent wants to discipline their children let alone spank them. But kids do need to know who is in charge and that when mom and dad say something that it isn’t a request but law and will be done. As long as they can manipulate or by some other means get what they want you can bet they will and kids like mine and yours who are very smart, well let’s just say had me and my wife not gotten a handle on it when we did, I don’t believe we would have been able to. 

   My son still gets in trouble and does stupid stuff, he’s a kid and he’s not supposed to be perfect, he can’t as none of us are. However, my son doesn’t throw his butt on the floor anymore nor does he throw a fit when game time is over or act a fool with me, his mom or older brother. The rest of it...... well it’s just normal kids stuff and that I can deal with. So my point to this novel, I feel your pain but dad, with all due respect why are you asking a bunch of strangers how to handle an 11 year old? I have no doubt that you do not ask what to do if someone is to hurt a member of your family. No you just go handle that then and there. Your a good dad, if you weren’t you wouldn’t take the time to have asked and my statement wasn’t meant to be mean or ugly but rather express. It’s ok to do what you already know what needs to be done and don’t need a bunch of stranger permission nor what I feel to be the really point, validated. It’s easy to tell you are struggling with this and like I said, no parent wants to have to discipline ie (spank) or come at their children as the bad guy. From my dad to me let me pass this on to you. I’m not my child’s friend, I’m their parent. If I do my job or being their parent we will end up the best of friends. You’re going to have a harder road to go than normal because he already has that learn behavior but I can promise that it will payoff in the end. By the way all of my children call me daily or come by and I have a great relationship with them all. My little gamester well, like I said that’s not a problem anymore. That would be due to ex wife number 3🤦🏼‍♂️. She helped me fix some of my problems, one of which was getting it through my thick skull that giving my boys everything that money could by didn’t make me a good responsible one. Giving them my time and being involved did. Yes I spent time with them but I didn’t totally invest my time. I can’t explain it to you but nowadays and before my divorce my boys almost became an obsession. Instead of making or finding a reason why I couldn’t or to busy to play, coach or whatever I was finding a way to do it. That made me a better dad all around and now PawPaw to six😳grandchildren. Good luck my friend hang in there Dad your rewards will vastly out weigh the current weight of this struggle",gi49evz,N/A

Sure, they're angry when I make them turn something off, but it's reduced how they react while playing and it reduces screen time.

>it also results in arguments within the household with my wife and I. 

Before you do anything else, you two need to have a discussion and come to an agreement. This is a two person job and it's never going to work if you put your foot down and mom just gives in. Whatever you tell decide, you have to warn him about it, give him a chance to fix it before you apply it, and then follow through. This is the reason it hasn't worked before... You guys keep giving in so he doesn't have to really change... He just has to hold out for a while until you give in again. And this will apply to so many things in the next seven years. He's testing you and, so far, he's running.

>I have a younger daughter who is complete opposite, she can play any game whatsoever but you never hear her losing her shit. 

That's okay. Everybody is different. You and your siblings were different; your wife and her siblings were different; etc. It's not nurture *vs* nature... It's nurture + nature. Nurture can help us improve on some of the things individuals are born naturally with. Your daughter doesn't need that extra nurture in the patience/gaming category, but your son does; if you really thought about it, you'll easily be able to find something that she needs or needed extra nurture with that your son didn't.

In the same wheelhouse, everybody responds differently to different approaches in lessons and discipline. Some kids respond to warnings while others require suffering the consequence before learning. And even then, the effectiveness of consequences vary. We're all different, and it's our jobs as parents to find what our child responds to best. 

It sounds cruel, but the reality of it is you have to find what they like and exploit it. My oldest *loves* the computer, so our go to with him is rewarding more game time or taking away game time. My second couldn't care less if we took away the computer... But the second we threaten the Nintendo, he straightens up. My oldest responds fine if you use a firm voice when he's misbehaving... My second panics and is often reduced to tears if you raise your voice, so we have to take him aside calmly and into another room for a one on one discussion.

If your son cries ""how come *she* gets to play!?"" after you discuss how games are having a negative effect on him, tell him the truth: ""she's not struggling with patience when she plays... You are."" 

>emotionally and socially he's lacking.

What do you mean my emotionally lacking? Because it's understandable at this age to not have your emotions under complete control. It's important for him to learn that emotions are fine... It's how we handle our emotions that matter. There's nothing wrong with being sad or angry. Crying is fine, wanting to be alone is fine. What's not acceptable is screaming at the tv, throwing controllers, yelling at the people around you for walking nearby while you're playing, or saying hurtful things to people. The best thing you can do for him is to be examples. 

I grew up in a house where everybody fought for the last word in a fight... That's when things were said that you couldn't take back. When I got married, this was the hardest thing for me to overcome, but eventually I did. Now, my husband and I both practice stepping away when we're angry to prevent saying things we regret, and then we bring it up later. (Stepping into another room, not up and leaving the house!) We also do this with the kids. When they're angry, we send them to their room for a ""cool down time"". It's not a time out...they can play with toys, read books, even take the Nintendo or tablet with them, but they can't come out until they are calm and capable of having a conversation about what the problem is and how to handle it. We started these ""cool down times"" 2 years ago and I've seen a big difference. They go up to their rooms in their own when they're mad now. They also have journals to write in, in case they are afraid to tell me or dad something. 

>Covid makes it difficult too as we have been going as much as we can as a family, although it's always a battle to get my son out. 

Family time together is great, but you have to make sure he's also getting the alone time he needs. That doesn't mean the alone time has to be at the XBOX or computer. My second actually really likes alone time, and I have to make sure the oldest and youngest leave him alone during these times. 

It's hard to find the right balance for some people, because while he needs alone time, he shouldn't be in his room 24/7. Do you guys have meals together as a family? That's a rule in my house. Even if you're not hungry, you have to sit at the dinner table. It's when we can all chat and find out what everyone did that day. It may not sound like a lot of time, but it can really make a difference.

>It's not like I can send him out to play. 

Why not? Can you not trust him to just ride his bike around the block or play in the yard without close contact with neighbors? If the weather is good, it's important to go outside now and then for some fresh air. Can you or dad take him out on a bike ride or hike together, or even just to the yard to play catch? It's a good opportunity for him to get one on one time with his parents. 

>do I ban him completely from the games that trigger him?

I would. But it will only work as long as you're able to stick to your word this time and actually keep him away until he learns to control his temper.",gi54v23,N/A

I feel really bad about this. We used to be an active, involved family on the go who took our kids to playdates and science museums and playgrounds, really social with lots to keep them busy. This year hit, and everything went away. I definitely thought my 7 year old daughter was spending too much time on screens, but reading the posts, that's how everybody was sounding, and what else could we do? Plus she's older so I figured it's natural for her to not want to play with toys, not want to go outside as much. Her big sister likes going on walks with me, drawing, reading books, and playing videogames - kids just have to find their own balance. But the 7 year old seemed to want to play games every waking hour. When she NEVER wanted to go outside anymore and cried about our family camping trip, I just figured she needed school to start so she could detox a little.

School started (in person, thank goodness) and she constantly whines about how she hates it. Her teacher said she doesn't even play with other kids on the playground, just walks around by herself and says ""I wish I was home playing minecraft."" Between roblox, animal crossing, that impostor game, I think I've screwed my kid up and fried her brain. Is ANY gaming okay for her? Do we need to treat this like AA and take away ALL of it for a few weeks? Set an evening cutoff time? What other activities can we do at home to distract her? I don't know what to do next. My husband likes screens way too much, he's admitting we have a problem but doesn't like my ideas of a 7pm family cutoff time or eating dinner around the table every night. I think I have to strong-arm him too though. Maybe I'm posting just to vent, but we've gone too far and now I don't know how to get back.",N/A,N/A

I'd say this is a bare minimum to start. It sets a good example to have everyone in on the gameplan, so I suggest convincing your husband to observe the same moderation you expect from your daughter.

I would just say to set boundaries, such as 1 hour a day, after dinner/chores/homework are done, etc. Taking it all away isn't that fair to her, especially if she might have friends online that she plays with. If her social circle or interests lie in these games, taking it all away is basically attacking her identity.",g8x5leb,N/A

Hey all this is gonna be long so bare with me... I have a 12 year old who is addicted to her cell phone. She literally from the minute she is up to the minute she goes to bed is on her phone. I am unsure how to even START on breaking that addiction... I guess I should give a bit of backstory.

So, I had her when I was 17 and was a single parent until I met her step dad when she was four. We moved in together and he became dad. We were together for seven years and she didn't get a cell until she was around 9 but it broke and we took it away. She got another one this last year because me and him for reasons I can't disclose, broke it off and she was having to be alone at home by herself for hours at a time while I worked.

Even before that: shes been obsessed with FNAF and mine craft and roblox etc etc... Well, now I am living in my ex's parents house because I can't find a place of my own/afford it right now after moving back to our home state. My in laws have expressed concern because I can't seem to break her habit. I want to take her phone away (and i have) and she cries for a while and then gets over it and goes RIGHT back into her same old addiction.

We also have two dogs one of which is outside due to his size. By outside I mean yeah he has a whole back yard but he also has a nice closed off room that is climate controlled with a bed and plenty of water plus other dogs to play with. My depression has taken a hold of me and I am fighting it really badly.. I don't spend as much time with the dog as I should. I have thought about rehoming him because it would be better in the long run because he needs someone who will walk him everyday and give him attention. Anytime I mention this, she cries and gets upset.

Finally, two days ago, I told her I give her a week to prove to me she wants this dog. She needs to go give him attention, clean up after him, brush him, etc etc. Because for me? Yeah I love the dog but understand when I need to let go of something because I am an adult.  I also told her I wanted to start taking her phone away and not giving it back until she does her chores... I just recently got a new job which would mean she wouldn't get it back until I got home from work (around 4 pm) because my in laws are very big on ""we aren't parents we won't help you parent"" mind set. She also can't seem to EVER wake up on her own and that is also a problem. So, I don't know what to do?

She has toys, she has all the drawing stuff she could ever want.. And she gets to see friends (when restrictions allow it). I also haven't been forcing her to do school work or anything and I know shes probably fallen behind and I just can't seem to make her do ANYTHING without a huge water fall of tears and crying. I want her to be a successful individual and being addicted to her phone isn't going to help with that... What do I do? Do I start taking her phone back and only give it back when I am off work? I told her she needed to be proactive in her chores which literally is only put her clothes away and clean the cat box once a day. I don't feel like that is even a lot for her to do. I tried asking her what would motivate her but she doesn't seem to know either... I hate this and don't wanna be the bad guy at all with her, but I feel I have to.

EDIT: As of right now, I am taking her phone away at 10 pm when I go to bed. She will get it back after chores are done and when I am home from work so 4 to 10 and a little extra on the weekends. I have given her a list of things she needs to do and we will see if they get done.

I also have decided to be proactive and now am taking my dog to the dog park. He was there for 45 minutes and ran himself ragged and is now happy to rest. I am also making her go with me so she gets out of the house.",N/A,N/A

Rehome the dog since neither of you are able or willing (depending on the case) to care for it properly. Sure, she will cry, but it is what is best for the dog.

Take away the damn phone, and don't give it back! If the phone is the source of the conflict, then eliminate that need. Sure, she won't thank you for it, but your job is to set boundaries and ENFORCE them. Heck, my 5 year old has been throwing crying tantrums all day because we decided he needed a tech detox after being given free reign while we work. Do I like hearing him cry?

First, the cellphone... My 12yo is the same way. Most of her friends are the same way. I'm not sure it's really a phone addiction as much as just not having a hobby. Before she got her phone, she was just bored all the time - she's not a big reader, she doesn't like coloring, she doesn't like crafts, she doesn't play with toys alone... Sometimes she'll watch some Netflix but that's not really that different, is it?

But I try to see it another way too... You're on Reddit right now. I'm on Reddit right now. I play video games, I watch Netflix... Ok I read at night, but I can't focus to read during the day either. When I was a kid... I played video games and watched TV too...

Add to that the whole lockdown thing and they can't go out and play with friends (my son plays video games with his friend, my daughter bikes etc).

That being said - a big problem I've seen with cellphones is that it seems that everyone's attention span is getting shorter... maybe that's just me... but again, if you think she spends too much time on her phone and doesn't do her chores, you're the adult, take it away (I do that too). Or take the phone at night and give it back in the morning when the chores are done.

The attitude thing - I have the same problem, same with getting them to get up in the morning etc... so I don't really have an answer unfortunately...

Yes, I think you need to start setting limits with her phone. She's having the 12 year old equivalent of tantrums because she knows you'll give in. Do not let her do this. Being a parent to a pre-teen or teenager is all about picking your battles, and there are some things to let go: what she wears, how much she eats, when she takes a shower, what books she reads. But in nearly every scientific study of screen time on the developing brain, it's shown to be almost universally bad. Clearly it's having a negative effect on her quality of life and her ability to be productive, and she as a 12 year old isn't mature enough to see this for herself. This is a battle you as her parent should fight.

12 is very young to have a smartphone. Most experts say to give your kid a flip phone or no phone at all until 8th grade. I get that we're in a time when she can't see her friends in person as often, but I think letting her do zoom calls with her friends on your phone when you're home isn't too much to ask. I'd say nip this in the bud. 1-2 hours per day is plenty of screen time for a 12 year old. In fact, I'd say 2 hours is generous. This is an awesome excuse to steer her towards doing more analog activities. The phone is coming to work with you during the day, and you're letting her use it after dinner and taking it back 2 hours later. And do this all summer. I promise you that as soon as you give her unlimited time with the phone, you'll be right back where you started. Let's face it. Phones are fun, and games like Minecraft are designed to make you never want to stop playing. But they inhibit your child's ability to spend her summer doing things that can actually stimulate her mind, like reading or drawing or playing with siblings or pets. You bought the phone. You pay the phone's service. This is YOUR phone that you have so kindly offered to let her use. You mention that she has plenty of other activities she can do at home that don't involve screens. I promise that when all of our kids are on the psychiatrist's couch in 10 years, ""My mom only let me play Minecraft for an hour and a half a day when I was 12"" will not come up (I'm joking of course haha).

I'd also recommend you take a look at the book *How to Talk so Teens Will Listen, and How to Listen so Teens Will Talk.* Awesome read on how to communicate effectively with your girl in this stage.

Stay calm and firm. Don't give in to her dramatics, and don't let her bait you into arguing or yelling. The opportunity to spend a summer mostly away from screens developing her interests in other areas really is something she'll thank you for as an adult.",fsnnyiq,N/A

""You may have your phone from X to Y time, if all your chores have been done."" And make sure she knows what you mean by 'done'.

Laundry folded and put neatly in the drawers, not crammed in balls. 

If she likes to listen to music while drawing, cool! Get a Google home she can ask to play her play list. Give her a radio. They still make MP3 players. If she can't wake herself up, a clock radio is great for that. 

As for the dog, sit her down, write down what it looks like to take care of the dog, and tell her she has one week. If she can't do it, that's okay, then the dog will be sent to a husky rescue where he can be appropriately rehomed. If there is a Humane Society accessible to you, sometimes they do low cost spay/neuter. That's how I got my cats fixed. 

You do have to be the bad guy with her. Because you are her parent. I read you said she's going through some trauma, and that doesn't meant that boundaries go out the window.

I can't let her ride around this city because its too big and all her friends live way too far.

I mostly just hate how my in laws are getting onto me for it because they think shes on it too much (I do to) but then at the same time they are kind of the same way? I just can't bring it up. I am living in their house for free.

My dog is outside because I HAVE to have him outside. When I lived in my own place then he was inside but my in laws don't want him in the house and it is THEIR house. On top of that, he has a climate controlled room with a bed and water and other dogs so he isn't totally alone and he likes being outside. When we lived in our own place I had to fight him some days to come inside. His big thing is he wants more human attention. And yes the dog could use training I blame my ex for that and me not having the time. Its no excuse but I was literally gone 14 plus hours a day most of his life so he is hyper because hes a husky. I am also working on trying to get the money to neuter him to help (my ex was like ""my dog my balls I won't let you neuter him"" because he was an abusive asshole TBF)",fsnobb4,fsnnumq

Your daughter went through trauma (I'm presuming abuse), so this isn't a case of ""my 12 year old has an internet addiction"", it is ""my traumatised 12 year old has an internet addiction"", which is a different situation entirely.

If she uses her phone to help draw, and she is using drawing as a therapy, then she should be able to use it for a specified purpose and time frame. The exact framework is up to you, and if that is ""she has access to her phone from 4pm-9pm"" then that is fine, just stick to it.",fsnr1o1,fsnql6t

My son has been an only child up until 1 month ago. His dad and I split custody 50/50 and we have had a really great coparenting relationship pretty much the entire time, so 7+ years now. 

My son has ADHD and has been on medication for almost 3 years. He is in special education for behavior issues but he is very smart and we really think he is a great kid. He’s very easily entertained, he mostly wants to be alone in his room watching videos or playing Roblox in his free time. He will come out and watch movies with my husband and I, and if I ask or suggest that we do something (like today I asked if he would like to go on a walk) he usually says yes. 

The reason for feeling lazy/neglectful is because I realized today that the reason why we never do anything is because I don’t suggest things. I think this whole time I expected that he would ask to go do things like going to the park or whatever. But he never asks, I think because it’s out of sight/out of mind for him. It’s not that we never do stuff, but I know that I’m usually pretty tired so I kind of let it slip through the cracks most of the time. 

Should I be worried that he spends so much time alone or is this normal? I don’t expect him to have a ton of interaction with his sister because she is only 1 month old and sleeps a lot. But eventually I’m hoping that he takes an interest in her. 

Thanks in advance, hoping to hear from parents with kids around his age.",N/A,N/A

I would certainly limit screen time. It just isn't developmentally or mentally healthy to be glued to a screen. Reading is a wonderful option. He should be active daily. Roblox can have a lot of adult language and even predators on it, I would be careful with that one. Try doing something different with him once a week/every other week.

That's mostly a safety thing as well- [roblox has been known to have pedophiles on it](https://www.khou.com/article/tech/heres-how-pedophiles-trick-your-kids-through-video-games/285-d3da6a98-3c1c-491c-9f09-152fcaeb327a). That doesn't necessarily mean he shouldn't play, it just means an elementary-school child should only do things on screens in public areas of the house where an adult can walk by at any moment and see what they're doing. Not because I think they're sneaky, but because it's so easy for kids who don't know what they're doing to get sucked in, and if (god forbid) someone wants them to take pictures, it's harder for them to do that if they're not in a private space. This is an age where it's best to have screen time limits to encourage them to do other things: read books, play with legos, play outside if it's nice out, kick a ball around, play with the dog, go for a walk with you guys, draw, etc. For an elementary schooler, I think 3 hours a day of free time on screens is plenty during a pandemic, especially if Roblox is the only way he's seeing his friends, less once school is back in session. We're planning on relaxing our screen time limits once they're in middle school, but since he's so young I think it's important that you give him the chance to get interested in other hobbies as well. Games like Roblox are designed to be addicting and to make you want to play them for hours and hours, and so sometimes a hard limit is needed to give kids the chance to do other things.",gsuev22,N/A

My goofy, energetic, happy son becomes shy and withdrawn when we even mention doing a classroom zoom session. Even if we tell him he doesn't have to be on camera and it can just be pointed on what he's working on he says no.

I've tried to talk to him about his feelings or why he doesn't want to do it. All he gives is mumbling his answers ""no... I don't want to... I don't know""

He mostly says ""I don't know"" to everything I suggest or ask. He's never once had a bad interaction with anything like this. It's really frustrating because we have planned on doing homeschooling this year and his teachers are nice enough to offer flexible learning plans for him.

Does anyone have any tips? We just can't figure this one out. I've offered to buy minecraft or roblox so he can play with the teacher's kids (her idea) to get him to open up and see it can be fun but he just won't budge.",N/A,N/A

\[Long post for context, apologies in advance\]

My son is (i think) generally cheerful, kind and is not too poor in what he does. He likes drawing, making youtube videos, making/copying small games on Roblox and plays games. I think he has a thinking, logical mind. He is not top in class but he understands things well. 

Here are few things that has happened and i am worried to death. 

**In last one year, He has stopped**: 

Swimming - someone pooped in the pool and he does not like it now. also says, he knows how to swim, so stopped after reaching level 6/7. does not want to complete the full course. 

Drums - He enrolled in school club, went fine for first term and now just says he forgot (like 4-5 weeks) to attend. We took him off. 

Squash - Does not want to go on a Saturday afternoon with kids his age. Was fine going when a coach would teach him one to one. The coach has now gone to better opportunities, and he does not want to play/learn squash. 

Basketball - Went every monday for so many weeks. Now just does not want to go, saying other kids are not his age. 

Studies - sits for homework everyday and does homework, We have to remind him though.wants to do the bare minimum. 

Exercise - From Sep this year, he did exercising every morning for 20-30 mins. Stopped after a month, as soon as i kind of stopped asking him to do it. 

I guess, he fears losing and does not want to do anything because of that. He is happy playing games on computer, xbox, switch. He can independently create good structures in Minecraft etc. which i like, shows creative thinking.  

He likes drawing and is good at it. i bought books for him to improve- he does not use it . Asked him to learn from internet, he does not. **He does look at art and draws himself when he wants but is not systematic**. 

For other things, **he would not try and remember anything related to school, studies and any other class**. It is us who would remember for him. He is just not bothered/concerned about studies, sports, classes. 

**He also thinks/believes that few boys in class hate him and wants him to be in trouble all the time. Has only 1-2 okaysh friends**. But when he hangs out with others, he is fine, he is happy and normal kid. But when i ask, he says, he sits with other classes boys for lunch or he read in lunch time etc. 

From my part, i think **i have made few mistakes where i had scolded him on getting poor score in maths** and asked how could he make such silly mistakes etc. That has put him in fear that a bad score or a lose is going to get dad mad, i guess. 

Also, there was this one incident where on a trip, kids in his room accused him of stealing a boy's airpods as they were found around his bag. he denies it and i trust him. (as i believe we get him what he wants and had never shown any desire to get airpods)  We somehow resolved that but that has taken a toll on him as other kids call him names in school and was lonely for good 3-4 weeks. This was last year. 

As a parent, what is it that i am doing wrong? **I am worried that with no goal, no enthusiasm for anything and fear of losing in anything would make life very difficult for him**. **On top, he is not showing any seriousness in studies**, does the bare minimum, does not aspires to be good in any subject or beat a friend in scores or anything competitive. 

As a parent, i put emphasis on/advice on

\- study 2 hours daily, which he sits. scores in any subject not improving, i ask him to put some extra effort. he does not give a dime. 

\- have disciple in life

\- prepare to work hard, to work extra  weather in sports, studies or life in general. 

\- do some physical activity ( he has stopped all classes slowly) 

\- tell him that he need not be best but don't become dumb. with hard work everything is possible. 

\- tell him that he has a very intelligent mind and he needs to use it in right direction. 

\- tell him how my dad never asked me to study and i still studied as i wanted to do good in life. 

\- tell him that one needs to be good or great in something for a fulfilling life, being average and mediocre would end up in a average and mediocre life. 

\-  ask him to revise before exams, be proactive about school, homework, studies and everything in general. 

\- change attitude towards everything as i may die tomorrow and then suddenly life would be very difficult. 

**I sit with him and help him in studies, at times hours. I used to go play squash with him as well. I play chess with him, if he wants. I would take him for walks, would be in park when he cycles** ( i had to force him to do that as he does not want to leave the house). 

So, i think in my mind that i am doing everything that i could, i am still messing things up somehow. **What am i doing wrong**? **How do i motivate him to do things, become proactive and take responsibility of his own life as he grows**?",N/A,N/A

I mean all of the things you want for your son are good things but it sounds like you’re a little demanding as a parent.

He’s tried like a dozen things and maybe it’s just overwhelming for him? What if there was just one extra curricular that you said he must do instead of allowing him to quit everything.

As long as he is happy and doing well in school and not being a lazy so and so, I’d say he’s fine. The only thing I’d be concerned about is he seems to be drawn to more individual activities where he doesn’t have to interact with team members or friends.

Tow cents on how i personally see life: 

\- Days are long and years are short. Before one realizes, time would fly by and at times it would be too late to do certain things. Better to realize and understand things before it is too late. I want to emphasize that - i am doing very bad at that. 

\- By year 8, i had a goal. I wanted to do something and get out of my tiny village. I had ambition, goal and purpose. That is lacking here, but i think that's first world luxury given to children. Take time, make mistakes and learn things the hard way - may be that's for better. 

\- I had real fears about my life by the time i was 12 or 13. I could see myself leading and living a poor life if i did not work hard, excel at something. - As someone said in comments, i made a choice despite there being no pressure from my parents. I did make a choice, out of fear and being practical. My village has no scope for sports, arts,. nothing. I chose studies, as it could get me out of where i was. 

And this worries me, lack of goal, ambition, purpose, direction, motivation - whatever we may call it. Without these life is a flow and it will flow and one day he realizes that he is 18 or 20 and hell he should have been more serious about A or B or C. 

May be i am wrong.",f81tc4b,N/A

I get that you want him to do some kind of extracurricular activity, but one should be enough. Also the point of that activity should be to have fun, not for him to become the very best at it. That won't happen if you pressure him. Also, kids/tweens/teens are supposed to try different things and figure out what they like, so don't worry about him quitting stuff. 2 hours of study time a day is a lot, if you don't count homework time. When he's in high school the demands will increase drastically, so let him enjoy his free time as long as he can.",f9l1cbw,N/A

That speaks good about you. Let me tell you, I'm a young woman who had a father...quite similar to you. From work ethics, to ""I wont be there one day and you must be able to fend for yourself"".

 You and your child are different people.Being a 12 year old is harder than must of us remember. Each time he is having ""the hardest time of his life"" ....he really is. You say years go fast, but you can't expect him to understand it. He has only lived 12 of them and doesn't remember half of it. Right now, your son is not ""trying to become a..."". He isn't trying to get out of nowhere, to get the perfect grade to get in university, to become a musician, to win the swimming competition. He is...just living. And thats fine. He is growing as a person right now,it's never lost time. 

I would stick to some basics. You must talk to him, and tell him he has to remain in his activities (at least, during the full school year. If next year he wants to try a different thing, that can be talked). No ""i stoped going"". That should be met with the same seriousness as ""i skipped class"". Staying in a fixed activity will help him learn to deal with frustration (if whats happening is that he leaves whenever he finds trouble with it or feels he isn't being good enough), or to overcome pasiveness (learning to do what he must do, even if he isn't superpassionate about it).

Also, he is 12. Stop acting as if he needs you to get his things done on time. A reminder should be more than enough for him to do his homework. He doesn't and you get sent notes? He gets consecuences. No electronics, for example. 

On the other hand....you are trying to measure your kid with yourself, and that never ends right.

You are telling him how he must live his life, you are comparing him to how you used to be, you are telling him that he must be good or great to find happiness, that he is intelligent but he isn't using it the right way. Sir, in my opinion you are helping destroy your childs drive (and perhaps self-steem)

You want him to be self driven, but you are there telling him what to do. In multiple aspects of life, for what it seems. You are behind him to tell him to exercise. You try to tell him how to improve in HIS hobby. You nag him to do his homework, to study.Why would he start being selfdriven, when you seem to have the pilot sit ocupied? 

I wonder if you have heard the term ""helicopter parenting"". Some things about it may resonate with you. Sometimes, being too involved in your children life and decission making will end up hurting him. 

Be supportive of his hobbies (for real, don't try to change how he lives it with ""organized learning""). Take a step back with the naging, but tell him how since he is growing older he will get consecuences for his actions. Keep him to his promisses (after school activities falls in this), and let him thrive by himself. Children whose parents try to control how they develop to fit their standars end up feeling alienated from their parents

. ""We can't be good enough, we aren't doing enough, we aren't doing it the right way. If we where, why would our parents be constantly behind us telling us how to study? Asking why we stopped doing that?I guess I must be doing it wrong."" One day, we realise we where holding over ourselves standarts that werent ours, and we have to start building who we are whithout our parents voice telling us what we are (or must be). You are worried he will lament once he is 18 about loosing time. It way harder to look at your teens and tweens and think, ""I wished I had been able to be myself"" . Let him grow. Whats the worst that could happen (if you give him structure and love?). Perhaps he wont have life figured out by 18. Truth is, must of us don't. Thankfully, by 18, we still have our whole life to figure it out

You can message  if you want to talk about anything, but this reply is already too long.

Best wishes to you and your son",f82gwo1,f81tc4b

It is not so much the amount of activities. It is your attitude that he has to be ""great"" at something and that everything is possible with hard work. I understand where you are coming from; I guess as parents we always want to believe that our kids will be great. Reality is that most of us are ""just"" ordinary mediocre people leading average lives. There is nothing wrong with this. I would wager that, instead, focus on him leading a happy life, to do something that makes him proud of himself, is more important. This does not necessarily mean the same for everybody. Let him find out what he wants to be.

Children are very perceptive and I would guess that he feels that you have high expectations for him. There is not much worse than feeling like you disappoint your parents. It can easily lead to not trying due to fear of failing. Do you tell him that you are proud of him? Not for something he did, but for who he is? Does he feel confident about himself? Is he happy? Does he have friends? Those are the things I would focus on. For my children, I require that they keep up with their school and choose at least one activity.

I also want to note on your requirement to study two hours every day. That is just too much, in my opinion. Let his amount of homework determine how long he has to study. Let him be a kid and do other activities. See school as work, I imagine that he is there 6-8 hours a day. There is only so much your brain can absorb. It also needs to rest.",f81fuct,f81dxcf

Sorry, OP. Sometimes kids do want to do things and don’t follow through. But after the first time he quit something, I would have let him know that the next activity he chooses he’s not allowed to quit. By allowing him to quit you are allowing him to build a pattern where every time he faces an obstacle or something he doesn’t like, he can just decide to move away from it instead of getting over it.

Sports are supposed to build resilience and perseverance. They certainly did for me. But either your son has gotten used to quitting things without consequence or sports is really not his thing and you need to encourage him in other things.",f81euy8,f81dxcf

But back off with the constant messages that what he is doing isn't good and he needs to take a class or read a book to be good. That is just going to lead to a depressed adult that doesn't want to do anything. That is going to lead to a kid who figures they can never please their parent, so why bother?

When you say he chose those activities, are you saying he said ""I want to sign up for this"" or are you saying that you gave him a list of classes he could chose from and he chose one? And it isn't his fault you spent money on a class he doesn't want to finish. He is 12. Even adults can have a hard time judging if something will maintain their interest.

Exercise should be easy. Just run around outside with friends. Just play. It seems absurd to me that a 12 year old needs a structured activity to get exercise.",f81rqxl,f81dxcf

\+1 and thanks for this. I do tell him that i am proud of him for so many things: for his behavior with other kids in school. for example, he stood up to a bully who was bothering another girl; he stands like that. And he comes home and tells me these stories and i do tell him that he did the right thing and he makes us proud. 

As i said in the post, in general he is cheerful (plays with his sister). I do however believe that he is not confident about himself. :-(  

>For my children, I require that they keep up with their school and choose at least one activity.

I see what you are saying in terms of allowing him to quit but i thought by allowing him to quit i was allowing him not to do something he did not want to do any longer.

Yup, he did. he wanted those classes.

Indeed, if he and other friends go out and play. They don't! They keep playing on xbox, minecraft, roblox, switch. And hence my nudge that lets do some physical activity.

Hello!  
Been at home for 2+ months now and my kid is bored out of his mind. I don't blame him, I am too. It's just the two of us.  I try to keep us doing activities and so on of course, but I am wondering if anyone has any recommendation for a PC game he/we can play? I know he likes playing on my laptop, and I don't allow it often at all (less than monthly), but I'm thinking maybe it would be fun for him to get to play a bit more just until school starts back up.   


He is 6, somewhat easily spooked, and can read very well now so can't have a game where he can chat to other players or see their chat. He has a very logical focused brain, loves any that goes on puzzles, numbers and math.   
Also enjoying coding games both with toys and on his tablet - I have no idea how he learnt it as I don't know coding, but he loves it.   
He's enjoyed minecraft and roblox on tablet a lot in the past, and also keen on Mario that we played a bit on Nintendo Wii. We're not playing on tablet or Wii anymore though.

**TL, DR:** Can you suggest some kind of work around the house that my daughter can help with so that I can give her money for her hobby. At the same time, I want to start teaching her about work and money.

**Long version:**

I know this is a little tough to ask given the fact that my daughter is not even 6 yet.

So my daughter is quite into Roblox. I allow her to play because her friends all play and they always talk about it. She only plays 30 - 45 minutes a day and while she's quite reluctant to leave, it's usually pretty easy to engage her in another activity. 

Recently she asked me about buying Robux, which would need real money to buy, something like $5 for 400 Robux. While I usually deny her request, today I told her that I would think about it. I'm thinking maybe she can help me with some house chores and in turn, I'll pay her. This could be a good chance to teach her about work and money.

Do you think this is a good idea? I might not allow her to use all her earned money for Roblox, maybe only 50% while the rest will be put in a saving/investment account. And what kind of house chores should I ask her to do? I don't want to pay her for things like doing homework, putting the dishes in the dishwasher, or cleaning her toys. Would be something that usually I have to do. And at what rate should I pay her? Maybe minimum wage?",N/A,N/A

This is a half rant, half search for guidance. I'm an impending step dad, with a wedding coming in October. The fiance has 3 kids, each of which I care about and love, but each with their own unique difficulties. 

Tonight the middle kid, 10 years old and all too eager to step into the angst of teens was being bitey after coming home from his dad's (which could mean something). Anyways, he was playing things he's not supposed to on his computer, a mode in roblox. We put parental controls and blocked certain websites as best we can, but its something we need to look at further in the future. 

Anyways, his mother tells him to stop, he snaps, I reply for him to chill. I want to have a conversation with him, because he's been acting up a lot recently. So I try to take him over in the kitchen and talk. Ask questions. All I get is shrugs and a half lidded stare. I ask if he's just going to not listen, he nods in the affirmative. I want to throw him across the room, but I will never put hands on any of them.

Fiance and I agree he's off the computer for the rest of the night. I go to my office and blow of some steam into a heavy bag before listening to Stevie Ray Vaughn and trying to meditate. 

Now, I understand that teens will act this way. His older sister already does. He almost worships his dad, despite breaking promises and lying to avoid keeping him longer than normal. So, I feel like aside from it being teen angst, its also the ""You're not my dad"" situation. 

Right now I'm still feeling irritated and upset. I just don't want to be around him or talk to him. I know that's not very adult, but its how I feel at the moment. I'm not sure how to guide or help someone who insists on not listening. Who refuses to care about anything but themselves and their devices.

We live in the same house. So the most room I can get is avoiding, but avoiding doesn't seem to be the answer, and apparently talking is off the table. 

I get that there's no set way with dealing with teens. They're sporadic and feel adults are stupid half the time.

Any suggestions on how to ease tensions? Maybe better approach this before he gets set in this way of thinking?",N/A,N/A

If it is causing you stress and resentment to be this voice of reason in this kid’s life, take a step back and let his mom do it. It is not on you, and you don’t have to shoulder the responsibility of disciplining him or setting him straight.",gp9hna8,N/A

Focus on being a trusted adult in the household. Be the safe neutral space. You don't have to try to fill in for his dad. Don't fall into that trap.",gp9lf4u,N/A

I’m constantly being told to step back and leave it on dad. But this is my house too. She’s my child too. Maybe not by blood but she is. And in my home, there are rules. I would talk to your wife about what she expects from you as stepdad. Kind of like what she feels comfortable you participating in and what she doesn’t. My husband doesn’t mind me disciplining. He doesn’t mind me having the heart to hearts or the deep conversations. It’s a partnership. And my stepdaughters mom isn’t in my home so she has to follow my rules just as much as if she was at moms or if dad makes a rule. But my husband and I have talked this out. 

Maybe see what your wife would like from you and explain how you’re feeling the best you can. That’s what’s helped my husband and I with the bio parenting vs step parenting.",gp9z37v,N/A
