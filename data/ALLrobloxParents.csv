Can you limit Roblox to certain friends?

Roblox is so confusing to me but my 8 year old loves it. She’s the only one in her friend circle that can’t chat on the app or message. We’ve turned this off to protect her from creepy people and a couple girls that have tried to cyber bully her. 

Can you limit friends? Right now she can friend anyone she wants. 

Can you limit chat to certain friends? 

Feel stupid asking but I’m sure we have some amazing Roblox wizards in here. Thanks!",N/A,N/A

Best you can do is tell her not to add anyone she doesn't know and keep it to friends only. If she follows that rule you can make it so that only friends can message her and chat with her on the website. As far as in-game chat goes that's either all or nothing I think. Fortunately there's the increased chat filter for accounts under 13. You can set the experiences she's able to play to be suitable for all ages so she can't join the 9+ and 13+ reccomend games and hopefully she doesn't run into any weirdos which honestly is pretty rare unless you're joining weird games. Of course always monitor your kids online and teach them internet safety so they can make smart on their own as well. Teach them how to block anyone being mean by clicking their name on the leaderboardsand clicking the Block button and also make sure their settings are set so that only their friends can follow them into games.,iwery2p,N/A

No matter the age recommended games, if you monitor them long enough, some creep (often an older kid, far as I can tell) finds a way to get around the (lame) attempts to keep things child-friendly. Reporting them does nothing. And don't bother ever calling customer support on an issue...it's a joke. 

Good job restricting her chat ability, but that is half the reason many of them play. Good luck!",iwet3lq,iwery2p

Roblox's parental controls are extremely subpar and I constantly worry about what my daughter could be potentially exposed to in random public servers. For a while I had chat off, but that really takes a lot of the fun out of the games. 

I had an idea that could help other parents who are just as concerned.

What if there were a collection of private servers for the most popular games in Roblox and an adult moderator would be in those servers? The chat could be recorded and parents would know that the kids in the room have been invited privately by a parent account. Also, any kid who misbehaves will be kicked out and their activity reported back to their parent.

I tried account restrictions, but every game it recommends my son is restricted. It's too frustrating for him to click on game after game after game that was restricted.

When I saw a lot of the games it was recommending my 8-year-old, there is no way I would let him play without account restrictions (Squid Games, horror movies, etc.).

1) Roblox needs to only show games that can be played in recommendations and search when in curated mode. Or at a minimum only recommend games that can be played and in search clearly put an X and gray out the ones that are blocked.

2) Have an option to curate games, but allow chat with parent-approved friends.

3) Have an option to allow list and deny list additional games beyond what the account.

My ideal parental controls is that my child is only shown the games he is able to play, that are on the curated list, or approved by me. My ideal chat option is that my child can only chat with friends and that I control the friends list.

With the current account restrictions, my son was so frustrated with everything being blocked he uninstalled the game.

So bedtime arrives and my son needs to log off Roblox I go to his room to tell him its bedtime.I find he has access to a chat I'm greeted with the words ""I am just saying goodnight"" on screen is Car Destroying Simulator with a chat box open with the discord parody name ""bloxcord"" (cross server chat)Despite the account controls (at Roblox account level) disallowing chat due to the fact he has ASD and a tendency to be open with information.

This raises all kinds of alarm bells in my mind with other children globally who may be in a similar position.

I would advise any parent in this situation to 1) check if your little ones have played this and if so maybe check any new friend adds.

i joined this community to post this so I am sorry if its against any community standards I'm not here to scaremonger parents or badmouth the platform or even the developers of this game but it caused me a great concern

Despite combing the internet, there seems to be no mechanism by which you can either block those games which you feel are inappropriate for a child’s given age, OR if you go with the limited “curated content only” your child is prohibited from chatting with any friends in any game whatsoever.  This seems entirely unreasonable.  The over 13 under 13 setting does little to nothing.  The “allow only curated content” still shows ALL of the user generated content simply with an x over the play sign.  So the child can still see everything they can’t play, gets frustrated about it as they seek curated content, and can’t talk with friends.  

The “all or nothing” approach to safety and security for children feels more like mere lip service to parents who are trying to monitor their children’s internet time.  A 9 or 10 year old wants to play roblox so they can chat with their friends.  Prohibiting this defeats the purpose of the entire platform and really prohibits the child from effectively playing many of the games which require some level of communication.  Furthermore, displaying all that the child is not allowed to play merely insights frustration, as opposed to many other internet mechanisms by which a parent can block an app, a website, or a game that is inappropriate- after which it no longer shows up.  Furthermore, many of the games in the user generated content are age appropriate for younger kids and are the more popular games.  So the curated option includes removing the ability for a child to play games which are both popular and age appropriate (ie islands).  

At the same time, Roblox does nothing to monitor inappropriate games with xenophobic or sexual themes and deprives the parent of the ability to block these games from a child.  The entire parental safety mechanism is wholly inadequate.  Every other type of platform allows for customization of age rated games, customization of chat mechanisms and the ability of the parent to help their child play safely.  This includes the internet itself where websites can be blocked or allowed.  Lastly, the ability to monitor roblox chats only, along with inability to monitor in-game chats without the parent watching live, the entire time, is a serious failure of the platform.  

This system sets parents up for failure and promotes frustration and resentment with the children.  Roblox claims to be concerned about the safety and well-being of their players.  Yet they take no responsibility for monitoring user generated content, provide no realistic mechanism which allows a parent to work with the child to determine what is appropriate (which varies greatly even between ages 9 and 12) and places all responsibility of reporting inappropriate content or behavior on the users.  Which, for the record, they do little or nothing about.  

I have personally reported games which I have witnessed sexual content and the encouragement of inappropriate and sexual behavior.  I have provided screenshots as proof. I have received nothing more than a canned response saying I should enable “curated content” only and refusing to address the inability to chat once this is implemented.  I have reported games which promote violence in conjunction with xenophobic themes.  I provided screenshots in support thereof.  Again, I received a canned response about parental controls.  Never mind the fact that child can create a new account with nothing more than a name and a birthdate - which does nothing to block content aside from a few ### in chats.  

At what point does Roblox take any responsibility for their content and/or lack of useful safety settings which would at least allow a parent to have reasonable controls over what their child can play and do on the platform. 

If a Roblox is going to market to kids from 6 years of age (see their toys) to young adults, there needs to be more than the current useless, black and white, all or nothing parental controls.  The technology exists.  They simply refuse to implement it and/or make it available.  I can only assume their “concern for the children”propaganda is nothing more than a public affairs CYA as they hoist all of the responsibility of monitoring behavior and content of their platform onto their young players. Which maybe, just maybe would fly if they ever actually did anything about it.  But their statements re their concern are disingenuous at best given the lack of response when said reports are actually made.  

This is not unreasonable and this is not the ranting of a parent who doesn’t want to monitor their child’s activity.  These are the words of a concerned parent watching a company market to millions of young children, who are desperate for socialization (especially during a pandemic) and making millions on them and their parents while depriving users and their parents of the most simplistic of tools needed to ensure the safety and well being of our kids.  

And on a final note- the recommendations by some that parents can just block the game as a whole, or just set the all or nothing restrictions and get over it is not a response or solution.  It’s ignoring the problem and passing the buck.",N/A,N/A

I have been frustrated since downloading Roblox for my son, who is almost 9, a few months ago.

And games shouldn’t be shown if they aren’t allowed... when I turn on account restrictions, he basically struggles to find much of anything to play and gets upset going from game to game only to find it won’t let him play.

My 8yo plays Roblox for a couple of hours a day and twice now he’s had people want to trade with him and he gets scammed by trading big items he spent ages trying to get (legendaries and stuff) for items that people say are valuable but are not. He is super gullible and we tell him not to trade with strangers but he’s 8, and clearly easily influenced. 

Do you happen to know if there’s a way to:
1. track previous trades so I can see who this happened with?

1. if he got scammed in a game there is nothing that can be done, people create the games not roblox, there is no way of tracking trades or items.

2. If he got scammed out of roblox limited items there are ways to track his trades,check who the items went to and you can do a rollback by emailing roblox with all the proof needed.

&#x200B;

Judging by the fact that your son is only 8 years old getting scammed out of roblox limited items (fedoras, top hats, basically any item on the catalog that has that green box which says ""limited"") is extremely unlikely because the trading community is usually 13+",fykbtji,N/A

I was so happy to find this sub today. My 9yr old daughter has recently become enamored with Roblox. She's been on the game for a few years but she's really got into it during the lockdown. Her birthday is coming up in a few days and she's even planned a while bday party on the platform. I'm generally supportive of her playing the game as I see the value in the social element of the game however I've become concerned with how much actual time she spends on the platform. I looked to see if there was a way to see how much time she's spent playing the game but there doesn't seem to be a way to do this. So my question to those more experience Roblox parents....have you figured out some tricks to basically estimate how much actual time they spend.

Hi fellow parents of Robloxers. :)

My kiddos are fairly new to the game. I have them set up with 13> accounts and no chats, curated content only—all those restrictions.

I have two accounts for myself. One is a regular 13< (parent) account with no restrictions and the other is a 13> that mirrors the settings I have for my kiddos.

I try to log in with both to see what’s going on in the Roblox universe, and get a sense of what my children are experiencing.

My problem is that it seems SO OVERWHELMING to monitor it all. There are so many games, and it feels like it’s a crapshoot finding which ones are playable for restricted accounts. My kids keep begging to be allowed to chat, but the chat channels seen really weird to me. (I am an MMO player myself, so I do understand how random chats can get. But Roblox seems to be especially diverse in what I can expect to find there.)

How do you guys keep on top of your own safety concerns with this game? What resources do you recommend for parents? What are your own biggest safety concerns?",N/A,N/A

For parents who are struggling to keep their sanity, and their kids busy, I'd recommend introducing them to Roblox!

Roblox is a video game that can be played on phones/tablets or on the computer. It is VERY kid friendly and oriented and has good parental controls, and it helps with kids' creativity, imagination, social skills, grammar/spelling, and more.

There are lots of ""worlds"" kids can explore there, including going to a waterpark, delivering pizza at a pizza place, baking cookies, even going to school! Enough to keep them busy and entertained for hours (if you need the time)

Both me and my wife work from home often, and we don't have care right now because of the coronavirus, and Roblox has been a blessing, keeping our kid busy when we need our time. She started playing just before all the covid events happened, and this really saved us.

She even started her own [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MirratheMermaid) which inspired other kids in her class to join and play the game and she can play with her classmates and have ""playdates"" on Roblox instead of in the real life. You can show those vids to your kids if you want them to see what Roblox is like and how fun it can be.

Also it's a game parents and kids can enjoy playing together sometimes too :)

So anyway hopefully this helps parents in similar situation!",N/A,N/A

I’ve never been one to pay for in app purchases on anything, but he’s so into it I figured I can use this as a reward for chores and good behaviour. 

I’m in Australia it looks like I can buy roblox gift cards for as little as $10 denominations, they seem to have bonus items or something 🤷‍♀️

Or is it better bang for buck to just get him a premium membership via my Apple ID? Or can I also get that with gift card? Bit confused on how it all works? 🤷‍♀️

Is the whole robux thing just a bit of a rip off for young kids? Would a 6 yr old know what to do with a premium membership?",N/A,N/A

The cheapest option for buying Robux is $4.99 and you get 400 Robux. The cheapest option for Premium is also $4.99 and you get 450 Robux. You will get more Robux with Premium but Premium membership can only be bought once a month. If you want to get more Robux after buying Premium you will have to buy the Robux directly or wait til next month for the membership to renew. If you already have Premium membership and go to buy Robux, you will get a 10% bonus with the purchase. With Premium, buying the $4.99 Robux option will get you 440 Robux instead of 400. 

Premium membership comes with some features a 6 year old won't use and may not even be aware of. There's hats for your avatar that are considered limited and can be traded with Premium, I doubt he will be trading hats. Premium also lets you upload shirts and pants for your avatar. At 6 I don't think he'll be doing that either. What Premium is good for is having a set date that your kid will get his Robux. If you allow the Premium membership to renew each month,there will be a set date your kid can look forward too that they will get his Robux. Might be nice to have it marked on a calendar, and have your kid understand their spending limit. Or you can buy them Robux when you feel they have earned it and that's perfectly alright too. Going to want to figure out how much Robux you're willing to spend though, 450 Robux may not go very far depending on what your kid buys or it can be exactly what they need.

I would talk to your kid and figure out exactly what they want it for and see if there's anything in mind he wants to buy. There's different things to spend Robux on. Robux can be spent on hats for your avatar and game passes for specific games. Hats and game passes will last forever on your account. There are some purchases inside Roblox games that aren't permanent though, would recommend making sure you stray away from buying those. Roblox also doesn't set the prices of everything, the game creators do. It's always good to know what you're buying and seeing if the benefit of having it outweighs the cost. There's also no point in buying game passes for a game your kid will only play for a day, get game passes in a game you know they play often. Robux can be thrown away really easy so you might want to monitor purchases.

This is a lot longer than intended but there's a lot of different parts to Roblox parents and even kids may not understand when it comes to purchases. If you have any more questions about anything on Roblox feel free to ask.",fpi8uzn,N/A

Roblox monetized it's in-game currency in an effort to rope-in hardcore game or content developers to their game, most of the time when you see a really well made game it was made by a team of developers not for the purpose of hobbies, but because they are getting paid! Any Robux gained from their content can be traded in for cash.This is why Robux is so expensive to buy in the first place.",foy7t0p,N/A

I would recommend that if you choose to buy him some robux. Choose the $4.99 option for 400 robux. That is enough (assuming your son is smart with spending it) to make a decent unique avatar. For most user created shirts and pants, only costs 5 robux each. A hair item costs 75 robux on average. 400 robux gives him plenty of options.",foxp5aq,foxabwa

For example today, I only made 1 trade and made a 2k profit in value, roblox trading might feel like the stock market sometimes ;) 

Anyway, buying a kid a limited item worth 100$ its a very bad idea since he might get scammed , there is nothing special about limited items , just the fact that you can trade/sell them

The best way of understanding the complexity of roblox trading is by checking out this website:  [https://www.rolimons.com/](https://www.rolimons.com/)  you can also get statistics about players/games",fykek59,foxs08k

Roblox is created for kids. So technically, a 6 year old can play it just fine. Most roblox games are created as PG as possible for kids. With the exception of some games like horror games and war games.  


But that doesn't stop teenagers and adults from playing the game. Granted, I'm 18 and I play roblox, been playing since I was 12. but I'm just here to warn you. A lot of older kids and sometimes even adults can get a little rough ingame. They bypass the chat filters to curse and insult other users. I've been roblox for a while and I have seen a lot of inmature players who think its funny to insult people, joke about mental illnesses, and act explicit in a kids game. Not everyone acts like this, but every roblox game has its fair share of toxic players that ruin the fun.  


I would say 11 would be the absolute minimum age someone can play roblox. Even though roblox markets itself as a kids game and is made as a kids game, the older and toxic players ruin it. The game is more PG13 at this point",foxq857,N/A
