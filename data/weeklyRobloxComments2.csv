My daughter is stuck on level 69 in the old version of TTOH. Every time she touches the pillar she dies. Any ideas of how to get around it?",jf4q9tl,N/A

so I play Roblox quite often with my niece because we live a couple of hours apart and it's a way to connect.

Most of the time she proposes we play role-play maps like Brookhaven or animal simulator. Which is ok, but I absolutely hate roleplaying, which I obviously won't be telling her. Bit still, I would like to find some games that I can maybe at least enjoy a little.

Obbies are fine, but the balancing part always ets me to fail.

So I'm looking for games that are maybe a bit more developed, maybe have quests or riddles you can solve. They also shouldn't have violent or sexual motifs.

Any ideas?",jfavedj,N/A

But, have you given discord a try? I'm pretty sure it's very popular for things like this. It's like Skype, but much better. You and her can download it and add each other, and start a call. It also has a video calling feature but unfortunately I have no idea if it can overlay onto the game, but the voice calling feature works like an absolute charm while playing Roblox. 

Now, Discord does have community servers that have built-in voice chat channels that others can join (like your daughter) but to get to them you have to look for servers specifically on Google or find them through discord community server search so they're not exactly easy access. But you might wanna be aware of that. 

It's available on Phone (Android or iOS) and iPad.",jfk4f71,jfh2ekf
