I have been frustrated since downloading Roblox for my son, who is almost 9, a few months ago. I would like to be able to block games, block content from other countries (just due to less monitoring), or even make my own ‚Äúcurated list‚Äù of games that I think are okay for him. And games shouldn‚Äôt be shown if they aren‚Äôt allowed... when I turn on account restrictions, he basically struggles to find much of anything to play and gets upset going from game to game only to find it won‚Äôt let him play. 

They really cater to kids and seem to be very driven by kids playing on the platform.  I wish they would take parental control settings seriously.",gx5jdbv,N/A

I tried account restrictions, but every game it recommends my son is restricted. It's too frustrating for him to click on game after game after game that was restricted.

When I saw a lot of the games it was recommending my 8-year-old, there is no way I would let him play without account restrictions (Squid Games, horror movies, etc.).

1) Roblox needs to only show games that can be played in recommendations and search when in curated mode. Or at a minimum only recommend games that can be played and in search clearly put an X and gray out the ones that are blocked.

2) Have an option to curate games, but allow chat with parent-approved friends.

3) Have an option to allow list and deny list additional games beyond what the account.

My ideal parental controls is that my child is only shown the games he is able to play, that are on the curated list, or approved by me. My ideal chat option is that my child can only chat with friends and that I control the friends list.

With the current account restrictions, my son was so frustrated with everything being blocked he uninstalled the game. He's tried talking me into allowing him to play without account restrictions, but there are inadequate parental controls without account restrictions and I have said no.",hqgk51b,N/A

I joined Roblox in 2009 and I remember playing them back then. They used to be more normal though. Get Eaten by a Giant Noob was one I remember and it was just a big blocky character and funny to die in stomach acid or go through the digestive tract. All these games probably stem from back then. Eventually people started using cartoon characters to draw attention and I guess now they're using real people. Using famous people is for click bait. I haven't played get eaten games in years and they might be fetish stuff now but I honestly don't think that was the original intention from the way older games.

You will get more Robux with Premium but Premium membership can only be bought once a month. If you want to get more Robux after buying Premium you will have to buy the Robux directly or wait til next month for the membership to renew. If you already have Premium membership and go to buy Robux, you will get a 10% bonus with the purchase. With Premium, buying the $4.99 Robux option will get you 440 Robux instead of 400. 

Premium membership comes with some features a 6 year old won't use and may not even be aware of. There's hats for your avatar that are considered limited and can be traded with Premium, I doubt he will be trading hats. Premium also lets you upload shirts and pants for your avatar. At 6 I don't think he'll be doing that either. What Premium is good for is having a set date that your kid will get his Robux. If you allow the Premium membership to renew each month,there will be a set date your kid can look forward too that they will get his Robux. Might be nice to have it marked on a calendar, and have your kid understand their spending limit. Or you can buy them Robux when you feel they have earned it and that's perfectly alright too. Going to want to figure out how much Robux you're willing to spend though, 450 Robux may not go very far depending on what your kid buys or it can be exactly what they need.

I would talk to your kid and figure out exactly what they want it for and see if there's anything in mind he wants to buy. There's different things to spend Robux on. Robux can be spent on hats for your avatar and game passes for specific games. Hats and game passes will last forever on your account. There are some purchases inside Roblox games that aren't permanent though, would recommend making sure you stray away from buying those. Roblox also doesn't set the prices of everything, the game creators do. It's always good to know what you're buying and seeing if the benefit of having it outweighs the cost. There's also no point in buying game passes for a game your kid will only play for a day, get game passes in a game you know they play often. Robux can be thrown away really easy so you might want to monitor purchases.

This is a lot longer than intended but there's a lot of different parts to Roblox parents and even kids may not understand when it comes to purchases. If you have any more questions about anything on Roblox feel free to ask.",fpi8uzn,N/A

Best you can do is tell her not to add anyone she doesn't know and keep it to friends only. If she follows that rule you can make it so that only friends can message her and chat with her on the website. As far as in-game chat goes that's either all or nothing I think. Fortunately there's the increased chat filter for accounts under 13. You can set the experiences she's able to play to be suitable for all ages so she can't join the 9+ and 13+ reccomend games and hopefully she doesn't run into any weirdos which honestly is pretty rare unless you're joining weird games. Of course always monitor your kids online and teach them internet safety so they can make smart on their own as well. Teach them how to block anyone being mean by clicking their name on the leaderboardsand clicking the Block button and also make sure their settings are set so that only their friends can follow them into games.,iwery2p,N/A

Roblox is created for kids. So technically, a 6 year old can play it just fine. Most roblox games are created as PG as possible for kids. With the exception of some games like horror games and war games.  


But that doesn't stop teenagers and adults from playing the game. Granted, I'm 18 and I play roblox, been playing since I was 12. but I'm just here to warn you. A lot of older kids and sometimes even adults can get a little rough ingame. They bypass the chat filters to curse and insult other users. I've been roblox for a while and I have seen a lot of inmature players who think its funny to insult people, joke about mental illnesses, and act explicit in a kids game. Not everyone acts like this, but every roblox game has its fair share of toxic players that ruin the fun.  


I would say 11 would be the absolute minimum age someone can play roblox. Even though roblox markets itself as a kids game and is made as a kids game, the older and toxic players ruin it. The game is more PG13 at this point",foxq857,N/A

The murder eliminates the innocents from the game before time runs out.
Innocents survive the murder.
Sheriff has too shoot the murder before they kill everyone.
There is no blood or gore in the game, and my 6 yr old cousin plays it all the time op and nothing happened to him.
However, if your child wants to trade weapons, especially high tier weapons that are worth a lot, learn the values of it because there are people out there that scam people who do not know values.
But if your playing flicker or something like that, I would not really recommend that game to anyone under the age of 10.",fwlujwa,N/A
