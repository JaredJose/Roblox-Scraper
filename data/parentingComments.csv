Idk that there’s any way to avoid old creepy pedophiles in this day and age but look at parental features, teach your child internet safety, look at what he’s actually playing or play as well, and set time limits for those types of games that don’t necessarily provide any education content would be my advice.

I know how unhelpful that sounds, but there really is no way around it. At this age, you opened pandora's box by allowing her to start the game in the first place. You need very clear expectations and rules for how long and when she gets to play. Use timers. Enforce it. Maybe she earns the game for a positive action? Whatever works for you. Make sure you explain *why* videogames are limited (brain junk food, no time for school/sleep, no family connection, etc.).

Her brain is addicted to the stimulus and it is a novelty. It might take time to wean her off. So you could start reducing her play time gradually. If you try and cut her off cold turkey, it will likely just lead to power struggles and anger. She likes this and YOU allowed it, so now arbitrarily taking it away is going to feel very unfair and confusing. The ultimate goal is to achieve a predictable, mutually agreed outcome in which she can have her game. And once she sort of gets used to *not* having it constantly and starts finding other ways to fill her time, she might not ask for it as much.

FYI, you should monitor her activity closely in the game. My kids aren't into this one personally, but I have heard it is possible for creeps to interact with kids if they have public access. I don't know how it works because, as I said, this isn't a favorite in our house. But you should look into it.",irlk3yf,N/A

We had a new baby and it kept him occupied during the time. He enjoyed it but he began to spend all of his time doing exactly what your daughter is doing. And his behavior was suffering too. Just epic meltdowns, super moody and not himself. Because of meltdowns/tantrums, we took away the PlayStation and tablet for two weeks at a time. First few days were brutal but he started going back to the things he used to love. Drawing, independent play, going outside, etc. He obviously needed more direction and help finding the next task to do to keep him occupied, but I don’t regret it. Then when he would get his tablet and stuff back, he would play for awhile and then randomly get bored and do something else. 

Much like adults when you decide your indulging too much into something and you try and fill your time with other things, that one big thing starts to lose its hold over you.

On school days my kids are not allowed screen time in the morning or after school (they need to get ready in the am and do homework or help out after school then they can play) but after supper they can have screen time until an hour before bedtime then it’s time to get ready for bed and read for half hour or so. This gets them about an hour- 90 mins a day for screens on weekdays depending on when we have supper.  weekends they have screen time before I get up in the morning then not again until after supper so probably 2-3 hours on the weekend. I find because it’s our routine they don’t really fight me on it as they know when there will be time for screens.

Once you establish this, stick to it.  It'll suck for a while because once it sinks in, she won't like it but tell her she's free to do any other activity other than things associated to a screen.",irmkb99,N/A

The big problem I see with my own five year old is that he asks for video games when he's feeling too tired or uncomfortable to entertain himself. Playing a game and having to stop just delays satisfying the need he needs to satisfy, so he melts down at the end.

So, my rule is that before playing, he has to have had a drink, eaten something of substance within the last hour, and gone to the toilet. If there has been evidence of overstimulation or poor regulation during the day so far, he can't play (not as a punishment, but because he'll probably have more difficultly holding himself together). 

And then I set an alarm for twenty minutes if it's a solo game (like teach your monster to read) or half an hour for a game he needs help for (like Spiro the dragon). He can finish the level/life/savepoint stage after the timer goes off, but not start a new one.

And then don’t cave no matter what - that is the most important part. Every time he has the fit, he loses it for a day - potentially longer if a day turns out to not be long enough. My son is a bit older, so the “not good for your brain” has been explained more and now I can say that being addicted to video games isn’t good for his brain - and feeling this upset about turning them off is a sign that he’s getting addicted, so time for a game break.

We did so many different gymnastics classes! Found out she hates soccer- loves to run, loves to kick, doesn't love running around and trying to kick a ball. She was HXC addicted to her iPad, which we gave back to her biomom and got her an android tablet we could control. She's still got an unhealthy relationship with technology, but it's much better than it used to be. We made changes incrementally and made sure to get her buy-in every step of the way. We used to limit her to 2 hours on weekdays, 3 on weekends but she would spend the entire time on YouTube. We recently changed it to unlimited time on weekdays and weekends, but we've limited YouTube to 1 hour. She will take a break from anything else to play with her toys or color, but YouTube would have her glued to that screen for hours on end.

A 12 yr old is old enough to start learning financial responsibility. I personally would recommend a prepaid debt card that she can use for these subscriptions using her own money that she's been able to save up or that she works for. These can be reloaded when they run out which also gives you the ability to limit her on how much she can spend. If there's no money on the card her subscriptions will automatically cancel and you xan take the opportunity to teach her how to cancel the subscription she pays for. If a prepaid card feels like too much you can also manage subscriptions with gift cards that can only be used on specific apps. She needs to be able to see how her money is being spent. Teaching her how to use a budget can also help her. But this will only work if you follow through with establishing boundaries with grandma. I'd also give her an electronics time out. She abused phone privileges so she looses the phone for a set amount of time. When you give it back make sure she understands why she lost the phone and what the consequence was and that it will be taken away for longer if it happens again. If she values having a phone she will respect the boundaries. I might recommend that if a phone is important for communication then if the problem persists after taking it away more than once then you xan downgrade her to a flip phone that only has minutes. These were things my parents did in similar situations when I was her age and it made a huge difference. You got this mama!,j39v4lf,N/A

She basically told us, in no uncertain terms that ANY online platform or game where chat is a function is a breeding ground for predators and it is never a matter of “if,” but definitely a matter of “when” someone unsavory contacts a child.  It’s not limited to Roblox, there were dozens of apps and games she listed that she regularly catches predators from…it was jarring and my husband and I just decided to not promote or allow those games for our kids.  They can play a lot of games (meaning we don’t punish them, we tell them why we don’t like certain games and we provide plenty of alternatives) but Roblox was a BIG one that the detective mentioned so we have sort of banned it from the get go.

1. Explain what is wrong and why it is wrong.
Throw in an explanation of what you felt when you saw this.

2. Monitor his activities. He's not old enough to navigate the complex social interactions on the internet on his own.
You need to have full insight into what he says in which settings. Get a keylogger in a worst case scenario.
It's either monitored internet or no internet.

3. STRICT end time for internet usage. Your router can most likely restrict when his devices can connect to the internet. Leverage it.

4. If he's on a Windows computer, use the parental controls from Microsoft to monitor app/game usage, browsing history and more.

My knee jerk reaction is to take away his online privileges. If you were to do that, you'd be taking away so much more than just online privileges. You would essentially be socially cutting him off (unless there are irl friends he has). This fact has me thinking that you should only use this as a last resort. Maybe use this as a boundary if the behavior continues?

Honestly though, the behavior is pretty normal around that age group. Is it gross? Yes, absolutely. Have a talk with him. Sit down and discuss how the things he's saying are offensive,  how it makes you feel, and that you don't want him broadcasting that type of energy. Then you can wrap up the conversation with. ""If I see this again, your privileges will be revoked."" This way you can clearly establish what your expectations are and what happens if he fails to meet those expectations.

Well... at 9 it's quite early to have sexual interests, but then again I watched porn at 8 so can't judge.

So still within normal range, although suspicious.

>Seeing those messages has got me worried and got me curious on what led him to say such things… he likes to play games such as minecraft and roblox. He’s homeschooled-online schooling, so his friends who likes to play games has a discord server that they use to socialize and use while they’re playing… he also watches a lot of YT videos of gamers.

Which gamers? Which games?

Roblox/Minecraft/YouTubers are not monoliths.

>Thinking abt those two factors has led me to assume that he might have picked up some bad content from some gamers (I sometimes overhear them saying bad words or trolling words that are inappropriate) or some of his friends might have said it.

Those are plausible reasons. However...

>But of course, I’m not totally sure

Then ask him directly.

>I just want to know how is the best way I can talk to him about this as I don’t just plainly want to say that its bad or shame him about it or say that he’s young enough to understand because he does and has already an idea to it.

My 10 year old twins have completely different personalities. Twin 1 got into all of this ""sex stuff"" a while ago, because he's more outgoing, and he belongs to a friend group with kids screaming ""69"" and ""Ooh daddy harder"" literally EVERY. SINGLE. FREAKING. SECOND. (I've been monitoring his interactions with this group.) Twin 2 is a bit more innocent and shy, and he hasn't even gotten the sex talk yet, (I was forced to give it to T1 because of an incident with his friends.) This innocence is slowly fading away because of school, and his brother and sister teaching him about all sorts of sexual crap. (I talked to them about it.) Both of them use messenger kids and discord. When T1 talked to his friends on discord, I caught him spamming 69 and things like ""U probably f\*ked \*girl's name\* last night"". Instead of panicking, I drank a glass of wine, and bought a book for the sex talk called ""sex is a funny word."" I taught him about how having sex is normal, and it's ok to be curious, but it is only for adults, and you should not talk/joke about this with friends. I also told him about how it's not ok to touch someone else's privates, and it's also not ok for someone to touch yours. (I mainly told him about this because one of his best friends is a girl, and I don't want anything to happen when they are both older.) It was kind of awkward, but now he knows wrong from right.

It seems to ebb and flow. She has type 1 diabetes, and as part of her care team, she has a psychologist that we work with to help her with her mental health. Lots of teaching through example and checking in with her. 

So my advice is this: the next time this happens, where you can see her mood turning difficult and disrespectful, take a step back and ask her is everything okay. If she gets defensive or rude, shoot her down calmly, explaining that you don't want to fight, point out that she seems stressed (because more often than not, in my experience, whatever is causing her stress or mood, usually has nothing to do with me at all) and say you're just checking in and you're there if she needs to talk. See if she wants a hug.

This tactic works almost every time for me and it teaches my daughter that she can come to me for support in times where things are getting the better of her. It shows her that we can tackle these problems together and that there's no shame in having her feelings and acknowledging them. We try to find proactive solutions to whatever is bothering her, which is a great tool for her to learn.

It also heads off a lot of arguments at the pass. So then when things are a bit calmer, I can talk to her about the value of being able to speak to each other with respect and understanding.

Obviously this isn't foolproof, and we've had plenty of arguments, and she can be a brat when she wants, but it's a great way to handle difficult moments, and not only with kids, I've found lol.

My son isn't medicated because it's not general practice in my country to medicate kids with ADHD. I have a nice relationship with my son. He confides in me, he likes to spend time with me and wants to include me in his activities. But I'm not a robot. I get snippy sometimes, I get frustrated sometimes and even angry (rarely, but still). I don't scream at him or hit him. My husband is in the ""good cop"" department too. It's pretty easy for him to be in that role since he's away so much, so I'm mostly the one enforcing the rules. And bingo, my son is ""afraid of me"". At least, that was what I thought because I had the feeling he valued my opinion too much, he used to tell my husband sometimes ""mom will be upset if I do this or that"", as he got older he had those sprouts when he would try to take care about me too much... I talked about it to his psychiatrist and psychologist. During one assessment, a long time ago, my son turned his head towards me before answering to almost all the questions the psychologist asked him. I couldn't understand why he had the need to do that, looked like he wanted to check on me and my reaction before talking and it looked to me like he was afraid of my reaction. It broke my heart to see that and I couldn't understand where that fear was coming from. Both the psychologist and the psychiatrist told me it's not fear as I understand it and I'm doing nothing wrong. When one parent is more or less absent a child takes notice of that fact and sees the mostly present parent as his one and only lifeline. Kids are subconsciously aware that the only thing separating them from the outside potentially ""threatening"" world are their parents. Usually the ""pressure"" is equally divided between both present parents as they are both viewed as lifelines, but when one parent is absent most of the ""pressure"" can be put on the present parent. In other words the child feels like the present parent is their ""rock"" and their only ""protector"" so they can shape their behavior accordingly. Apparently it's a perfectly normal reaction psychologically speaking. The other parent falling into the ""good cop"" role is also expected and common in those kind of scenarios.  Anyway, you and your child aren't the real problem here, your husband is. He should be aware that it's so very easy for him to play the ""good cop role"" since he's not there a lot. He should also understand that it's perfectly normal for you not to completely hide your emotions in front of your child as long as your behavior isn't abusive (and it isn't). Hiding your negative emotions would send your daughter the message that her negative emotions aren't normal either and that she should completely hide them too which is not a good path to take. We all have negative emotions sometimes, we all get frustrated and upset sometimes, but what is important is how we react to those emotions. Not screaming, being aggressive in any way is the way to go. So when I get angry or frustrated while enforcing a certain boundary and my son can see it I don't hide it or negate the way I feel. If he asks me if I'm upset, I tell him in a calm voice what I feel (short sentence) while keeping enforcing the boundaries and telling him that even though I'm upset in that particular moment I love him very much and I always will. 
My child's psychologist told me a year ago that our relationship is a delight to see, so I must be doing something right. I still think my son values my opinion too much and I'm working on him ""not caring much about what I think"" which my child's psychologist told me is so funny for him to see since people usually complain about the opposite behavior. Lol
Maybe talk to your husband, try to bring him to your child's specialist and voice your concerns there. It might help him understand you and your child more and deal with the situation with more understanding. Even if he's in a ""good cop"" role generally speaking, you should present a united front whenever your child is misbehaving because a child will use the rift they sense between their parents to their advantage to manipulate the situation and get what they want. ADHD doesn't mean your daughter  cannot be misbehaving and needing to be corrected. Sometimes it's hard to see a difference between the diagnosis and misbehaving, but it can be seen and a specialist can help you with that part too (I know it helped us).

That will only confuse a child, especially one with ADHD. I would tell him “you’re making this harder on me and you have to stop”.

At the same time, you need a break if you’re losing your temper with her. If she thinks you’re yelling, it really doesn’t matter the semantics of it. It’s clear that you are stressed. Can you hire a sitter one or two nights a week while he’s gone? 

Another thing- losing is EXTREMELY hard for children with ADHD. It’s something we have worked on a long time with my son. Is she on therapy? Is she on a behavior plan at home to help her cope with things like losing. If she is not, getting her into these things will help you tremendously.",j2ly6v8,N/A

I can't say who is right or wrong, probably everyone (you your daughter and your husband) are all right in some ways in this situation. She should be allowed to feel her feelings but you have to teach her healthy coping mechanisms and emotional regulation not just consequences.

No offense, but seriously stop feeling bad for yourself that you do it ""alone"". You aren't doing it alone, your husband is making money which is a huge help and he's home on the weekends. It's a tough life for sure (I know first hand, except I don't have a husband who comes home sometimes), but your mind frame on it is what will make it good or bad. Some days seriously just suck but MOST days are going to be defined by your mindset.

Your frustration with your husband I completely understand. Unfortunately he's not going to see it from your view because he's only doing a fraction of the parenting so he can't understand.

Take your mom power back. Handle this with both hands on the wheel. Your kid needs some grace and patience. Eating after tooth brushing a few times will not rot out her teeth. She needs to follow the rules, but whatever happened the night you made her brush her teeth stayed with her in a bad way. She likely was scared. Otherwise I doubt she'd even remember it by now. Learn to let the reins loosen up a bit. Only then can you truly guide your family from the front. A parent who sees their kid as a chore and micromanages their child always appears weak and like a challenge to be defeated for the child. She'll relax when you do.

I have ADHD myself, also unmedicated, something that seriously has helped is DBT and using the skills that are taught in DBT. You can find free copies of the skills online if you want. 

I feel like you were handling it properly, your husband just hasn't gotten the full picture of what happens when you're parenting. He might need to take a step back and just observe for a bit to see what happens, then you both can make adjustments. Your daughter also is dealing with her father being gone a lot and could possibly be dealing with some emotional issues regarding that. If anything a feeling of ""it's dad again, yay!""

This is something that occurs between 10 and 13 on average. This is the best time to teach empathy and emotional intelligence. First, model the behavior yourself. Second, talk with her about how others feel. Do it as an exercise and not a lecture: “do you remember that very angry person in front of us at the shop; what to you think they were feeling? How do you think they were making others feel? What would have been a more considerate way to act?” 

Over time, you can turn this into conversations about her behavior. “When you do this, how do you feel? How does it make others feel? What would have been a more considerate way to act?” Don’t treat it as punishment. 

Wisdom and compassion come in one of three ways: you learn it through personal experience, you learn it from the wisdom of others, or you learn it through therapy or academic study. Personal experience is normally negative: like when you do the wrong things and reflect on the social consequences. Wisdom from others is modeled and taught. Therapy only works if the person wants to change. Academically it only works if that a desire for the person to lean. 

That means the only control you have is to model the behavior and share your wisdom. Reinforce these lessons with love and affection to remind her that in the journey she is still accepted by you. Do this now because waiting until she is 15-18 is going to make teaching it that much harder. 

Also, now is a great time to find that second voice. Parents at this age of a child become less wise/cool in the eyes of a child. Having a mentor, coach, or teacher reinforce those values as a second voice can be a game changer. Finding ways to let her connect with someone outside of the house can really help in the context of teaching emotional intelligence, compassion, and wisdom even if those lessons don’t take hold for another 5 years.",j95aakm,N/A

my ""mom is sleep"" example is a good one, she woke up shortly after, got dressed and went to do something else cutting her sleep in half as she has to go to work night shift in a few hours, but all of this did happen with zero conversation about it. 

my wife just takes the hit on sleep, and moves on, and in turn the child doesn't learn that this is really bad behavour, i can't really step in in this situation, as this would undermine my wifes authority (?).

I have multiple times/week a conversation with her about some things that happen like in school, which are 100% the result of her not giving a shit about other people feelings. so i usually be calm and try to explain it, asking how she would feel if a friend just abandoned her because there another kid in school that's cooler now... or somethigns like that. She does understand it the message, and makes up a resolution on her own as a conclusion, but the implementation is rare as the rest of society isn't really wired like that.

There was one ""teachable moment"" a few weeks ago, as she did manhandle the cat's like all the time, despite me telling her that this isn't a nice thing to do and just because the cat trust her, and is much smaller than her, does not provide automatic permission to do this.

At some point i just started to do the same to her, and right after asked her opinion about how it feels, after telling me .. i just responded .. ""now you know how the cat feels"" :) 

that actually worked, she stop doing it. even if i'm not around, but that happend in the concealed space at home, where i have full control about everything that happens, once i'm out of sight, this things usually just snap right back to business as usual.",j95esqh,j95aakm

Also, YouTube is not currently subject to regulatory laws around advertising to kids, so some of these creators push self promotion to the extreme. I’ve seen videos aimed at children where over half the video was self promotion. This can be very predatory on young children.

1. Talk to your daughter about internet safety and etiquette in general .

2. Have an honest conversation about predators. The internet is like being at an amusement park. You may 5alk to the person in li e next to you but you do not give them identifiable information.

3. Get the user name of the person talking to her on roblox. Contact roblox and request that this account and all future accounts created by this person be blocked from accessing your daughter.  Also let them know you suspect it is a predator. If parents and kids don't report, the company doesn't know.

4. Find out what she enjoys about roblox. Minecraft is similar but from what my students tell me safer.

5. Start building an open relationship with your daughter. She needs to know she can tell you about her life without judgment or punishment. 

6. Leave her in school. You can not control her actions, she is an individual with her own thoughts and feelings.  If you pull her out of school, most likely she will resent you.

Back then, we had a little portable TV with a DVD player. My parents plugged it into the wall and put a movie on for us while they moved stuff in. Well, I had never moved before (I was probably around the same age as your son, actually!) and didn’t realize how long this took, especially with them needing to catch an elevator for every trip. In my child mind, I thought “oh my God, my parents have gone missing” and my sister and I looked out the window to find them — nowhere to be seen. Freaked out, we paused our movie and hopped in the elevator to go down to the lobby to search for our parents. My parents didn’t see us in the condo and we all essentially went up and down the elevators, missing each other each time, and I genuinely thought my parents either disappeared or left us for good. BOY were they mad when they finally found us!!! This was slightly before cell phones (at least, I didn’t have one yet) so there was no way to text/call/ping and the lobby people thought we were playing around so they said nothing.",iqp7ygg,N/A

That said, don’t feel guilty if you want to say something about it. It’s actually not a bad thing to let your kiddos know if you need some quiet time or changes in topic from time to time. 

Teaching kids to have empathy for others is a great life skill for not only at home but for social normals with others - no one would want to listen about how pink sparkly shoes are the best shoes in the world for hours, right? (Sorry, it’s a weird, random example but hang in there with me).  

Or maybe it’s been a long/ bad day and you’re just not in a mental state where you can hear one more freaking random fact about minecraft without wanting to pull your hair out, despite all the love you have for your child and not wanting to crush their soul/spirit/willingness to share with you in the future.

BUT the REALLY important part in teaching these lessons is that you 

- DON’T tell them / teach this lesson when they are in the middle of sharing otherwise you risk hurting your child and making them feel unconfident in wanting to share with you again in the future.

- DO share with them how much you love that they are excited and happy about the topics they bring up. That it’s awesome to share with people you love and you know care about you .

- DO listen when they share, even when it’s not a topic you really care about. It’s important to them and it’s the same way you would want to be treated when talking to a friend, right?  

- DO give them time to talk and after actively listening and asking engaging questions, go ahead and change subjects to let your child know it’s time for something new to talk about. If they don’t get it, you can always say “It was really fun to hear about your Minecraft Story today but I would also LOVE to hear about ....” 

- DO share and talk about things you like or are excited about with your child too!  It’s a great way for them to learn about being good listeners and getting an understanding of how healthy conversations work. (Keep in mind of your audience and where they are at developmentally though when bringing up your topics - you might have to talk in excited tones and include/exclude different facts when talking to a five year old but for a teenager you could have a less animated and more factual discussion.)

- DO tell your kids when you are having a rough time or are in need of a break and try to tell them in advance so you can avoid hurt feelings. 
Example I’ve told my kids: “Hey, I love you guys! I just want to give you the head’s up that mom here has had a bit of a rough day. I would be super grateful if we could talk and share things later when I know I’m not in a grumpy mood and I can give you the my best listening ears and attention that you deserve.“

Also a game they’re not into today can be their favorite game down the road. At first he wasn’t into Pokemon arceus and then he became obsessed until he beat it. Same with fortnite , it took a while til he decided he liked it. Also positive streamers help. Preston playz is cool and we like zacscottgames",ix3ulzs,N/A

And make it something fun between the two of you as well. My grandpa and I bonded over video games. He would play them and show me whatever he was playing when I came over. It’s one of my best childhood memories (even if the games were maybe a bit inappropriate haha but it never bothered me) and I think it’s why I still love video games today. I have been so excited to do the same thing with my kids. 

So far, they really love any games we share. My oldest and I played Sword and Shield together (she was 6-7 at the time) and she loved meeting up to battle the bigger Pokémon together. And just sharing how far we had gotten, tips for beating gyms, stuff like that. 

My youngest (currently 6) loves playing Mario Party or Big Brain Academy together. Or any game she sees me or her sister interested in. She just wants to be included. 

I don’t usually do the hard parts for them. I do occasionally make exceptions, like my youngest for some reason gets anxious about playing Bowser’s Big Blast in Mario Party so I just pick the color for her. 

I don’t make them keep going in a game if they want to quit. We have so many games that they jump around and always come back to the hard game eventually, so I don’t feel the need to force it. I take breaks from games when I get frustrated and come back to it, so I don’t see this an a bad thing.

For the most part I encourage her to do it, unless I know it was an especially tricky bit, then I would do it for her.

She's 8 now and does amazingly well, better than I was as a kid (all I played back in the day was Pokemon, so I never had to learn to control a camera for example.) We're a gaming family so it's our main bonding activity between all 3 of us. We all play FFXIV together now.",ix3larf,N/A

Then when he was 4 and a half we got a family switch with Mariokart which kept him and us entertained for months. I installed the switch parental control app on my phone so he can only play for an hour a day during the week and 1.5 hours on the weekends. Exceptions if it's family playing together- right now all three of us are playing through an old Marvel game so we do an extra hour if he wants. I've got a vague balance running in my head of hours of physical exercise outdoors = hours of screen time. When he gets super frustrated we generally just encourage him to keep trying, and talk him through the steps- the sense of accomplishment he gets when he manages something is worth it. 

We borrow switch games from our local libraries, and I'd really recommend it. 2 weeks gives you long enough to figure out if your kid likes a game enough to put it on a birthday or Chriatmas list.

This is the reason why there are so many games on the platform. There’s a lot of new games being added frequently.  Game creators can add in game purchases (purchased with Robux) which can be special features like unlimited in game currency, special boosts like being able to jump higher, unlock special packs, etc. It’s not necessary to buy these, sometimes it makes the game faster and easier.

There are many different types of games in Roblox.

My family enjoys the “tycoon” games. Where you earn “money” or whatever you’re collecting in the game and build your “base” or whatever you’re building in the game. There’s zoo tycoons (building and customizing your own zoo), Pizza restaurant tycoon, store tycoon, mall tycoon, etc. 

Since there are a lot of games that are NOT appropriate for little kids, it’s best to monitor them and even play with them. We’ve been playing it for a few years and LO only plays on Roblox when we’re playing with them. They’re also only allowed to play games that we have played ourselves and added to their favorite list so we know it’s appropriate. 

To name a few of our favorite games:

like Work at a Pizza Place, which allows you to earn money by “working” in various positions in a pizza restaurant, and you can buy furniture for your home in game, make your house bigger, buy clothes and accessories in that game. 

Club Roblox is a roleplaying game where it’s a city, you have your own house (that you can customize, upgrade, change), work in different buildings, roleplay in other careers like hospital, police station, daycare,etc. 

Build a boat for treasure is where you build a boat using blocks and if you can pass the course at the end there is a treasure chest where you can earn coins and new building materials. 

There’s a firefighter game (not sure what it was called) is great for little kids because you get to drive around the city in the firetruck and put out fires. 

Bee swarm simulator is a game where you collect pollen from flowers, take it to your hive where your bees make honey, and you use the honey as “money” to unlock more bees, bee hive spots, and to upgrade your tools.

There’s also shooting games (for older kids and adults)… we don’t play those. but there is a game called Big Paintball that we play sometimes which is just 2 teams (blue vs red) trying to get the other team. My husband found a game like Rust that he enjoys playing as well. 

There’s a whole bunch of different kinds of games that’s good for little kids and it’s fun for parents to play with their kids too. If you play it with little kids you can set their profile to their age and it won’t show inappropriate words in the chat for kids under (13 I think?) which is based on the age on their profile. You can also turn off the chat to prevent kids from seeing any chat at all (from other players) and it also prevents them from being able to chat. There’s even an account restriction which only allows curated content, from what I’ve seen from using this though, there are some games (like Work at a Pizza place) that aren’t allowed. I think you can still see all the games but it will only allow you to play specific games.",hjkc2mx,N/A

Her friends will have older siblings or cousins in middle school and everything is fair game by then. They love sharing with their younger sibs. You can’t shield her from the information, but you can have honest and open conversations about every topic she brings up. If she brings up non-binary, talk very intensely about what it is and what it means. Do not assume she knows the correct definition and application, as you appear to already have a good start with. It’s better for her to hear the truth from you than misinformation from others. 

A funny, relevant story: When I was exactly ten, I told my dad I was half-lesbian. He was extremely taken aback, wasn’t sure where I had learned about it, and started asking more questions. (This was way before Discord btw. Kids just find out.) Anyway, turns out I asked my grandma what lesbian meant and she said it’s the same thing as Lebanese. She was trying to avoid the conversation and didn’t think I was old enough. So in my mind, lesbian=Lebanese were interchangeable. I thought that for months. A very educational moment for us both and I was thrilled he was honest and open with the definition of lesbian, unlike my grandmother was, as I immediately felt the failure she set me up for by not explaining it to me when she could. Thank goodness my dad was open, honest, and gentle with the explanation or I could have embarrassed myself horridly in a different situation.",iwegikd,N/A

If she is truly *only* chatting and playing with friends who you know, then I don’t think it’s a concern. They would have the same conversations in real life.

With Roblox, the first step is to turn off the chat function, and agree together how to manage and monitor ‘friends’. Sit together and agree the criteria for adding friends. Annoyingly, this is what almost every platform calls any other user you connect with. For kids, a friend is a friend is a friend. Not a random. This is sadly not as easy as blocking or banning or any other one-click action. It’s a series of conversations and sharing with each other, so your child understands that people aren’t alway who they say they are, and randoms online aren’t necessarily the same as friends offline. 

If it’s not Roblox today, it’ll be something else. It’s good to start today. And be honest. Tell her that you’re sorry, and worry, and can see she’s feeling hurt. You will both be fine.

I’m not sad about it. I felt more pressure when forced to interact in lessons and other social activities and despite these social interaction ordeals I don’t struggle socially as an adult. Just it’s all within my terms where as a child you don’t always get a choice.

You could argue you don’t get a choice interacting within work environments but as an adult we choose those environments we are in. 

You’re son despite the challenges will likely find a group of friends whom are friends for life and stick with them. This happened for me at 17, because I got to choose who I wanted my friends to be. School and social things from the age of 10 is meaningless to me. 

I say above because your son sounds somewhat chilled about it and that was me. But all I’d say is keep checking up on him, because that doesn’t mean that on those odd days I didn’t feel lonely, just as a whole didn’t bother me.

It might help to step back and consider the big picture of your entire school year... taking a month off of screens might feel like a huge setback but if it saves your year and makes the rest of your time more productive... maybe worth it? In that time you take off screens you could maybe try redirecting his attention into things like educational board games or borrowing a large selection of books on different subjects and see what piques his interest and go from there. And then start slowly reintroducing screens with limits once he seems like he's doing better.

The opposite approach could be to lean into it... I don't know about roblox but minecraft does provide some avenues for creativity and spacial reasoning. Perhaps you could find some way to use this to your advantage? You could agree to let him have more time playing minecraft if he uses that time to say, recreate topography or famous landmarks. Then he'll have to do some research on like the arc de triomphe or whatever in order to build it in minecraft. And maybe you could get him to write some notes on it while he's working on it.

She now accepts that it's up to us to decide when ""that's enough tablet time now"".

IMO it's never too late to start reducing screen time and allowing it only at certain moments. So if you need 30 mins to cook supper, let that be the tablet half hour, and no other time during the day. Or put Bluey on TV or something, if he won't do something more creative.",ip7c7af,N/A

You were (and are) trying to survive and sometimes you just have to do the thing you swore you'd never do. Take a beat and tell yourself you didn't screw your kid up. It's gonna be okay.

Now, if you want, I'd try a timer on the tablet. Say he always uses it for four hours a day - set the timer for 15 minutes less (so 3 hours, 45 minutes) for a couple days. Then do 15 more minutes. Once it times out, it's out. Do this every four to five days until you're at a time limit you're okay with him having.

I'd also recommend going through toys and putting some away. Do you have room to rotate books and toys every week or two to keep it exciting? That might help him become engaged in them again.

It sounds like he's not on a track you want him to be on developmentally, as far as independence, self-sufficiency, and attention. 

However, my 4-year-old has never had a tablet or even held a phone without me also holding it, and I will say cultivating independent play at this age can still be a struggle. 

He's recently begun paying more attention to ""projects"" like elaborate drawings, looking at search and find books like Waldo, and longer pretend play and building. This might be a good time to buy a fun independent toy like our current favorite, Lego.",ip79qzz,N/A

He is also an only, and he also wasn’t really the type for natural independent play. It was something we needed to work on and grow with over the years. He has time limits even today (he’s 12).

Another thing, we check with friends parents if kids can play minecraft at ours first. You can also ask that the parents restrict access to certain things when your child is in their care.

Go on YouTube and find piano transposes of their favorite songs .  You can usually find some that are beginner friendly, and most YouTubers give their sheet music for free or for sale.

They can also go find music themselves that they might like.  Maybe they don't want to play bach, but like to try Debussy.

If they're real beginners it'll be pretty tough to do, but past like intro to piano you should be able to find music.

Once a week for an hour- okay for some students. It doesn't give them enough time to practice, and, imo compounds the issue of getting stuck on the same piece. 

In my experience, the biggest obstacles to practicing and improvement are: not having a ""fun"" element to their lessons or to their practicing, practicing incorrectly, and trying to practice too much or trying to cram practicing. Shorter amounts of time practicing daily are better than longer amounts occasionally. I would suggest talking to their teacher (if you haven't already) about good practice habits. If they're just playing through the entire piece over and over, for example, it won't help them get better. Lastly, practice sessions should always end with something fun- a piece they have already mastered and enjoy playing, their own composition, a popular song they like, etc.

Good luck!",ipzl04j,N/A

What you haven't said is how you respond to complaining and whining (and presumably having tantrums) constantly. Your response to this is going to be important in (well mine anyway) a response. 

Draw your line. Make your expectations clean. Set boundaries.... then stick to them. Never... ever... cave or compromise. ""One thing and that's it."" then do the one thing and nothing else. Don't negotiate with terrorists (is my favourite term when talking about dealing with children). 

Im sorry that your early life kinda sucked; and from experience I know how that parlays into overcompensation and spoiling of one's kids. But you're not doing _yourself_, or her to be honest, an favours by not setting reasonable expectations and enforcing limits. 

Next time, before you get her anything, sit her down. ""Hey. ITs Tuesday, that means we go to the store. When we get there, I will get you _ONE_ <thing she wants>. But that's it until next Tuesday and I mean it. No tantrums no complaining"". And then do not under any circumstances go back on that until next Tuesday. If you do this two or three cycles in a row and hold to your restriction (and promise) then Im willing to bet it goes away. 

But during those first few cycles... you're in for a rough time. Whining, complaints. ""Im sorry, I said ONE, you got ONE, that's it until Tuesday."" Be prepared for how you handle a tantrum. My advice: ignore her completely. If she wants to flop on the floor and throw stuff and act like... err.. a 5 yr old having a tantrum, ignore her (I mean, like make sure she doesn't hurt herself, but otherwise..). WHe she gets in your face and screams in your ear, calmly turn to her and say ""Im sorry you feel that way but you're not behaving very nicely. Come back to me when you're willing to behave nicely and not scream in my ear."" Gonna be tough, but it will bear fruit.

This will sound rather cold, but I think its appropriate: as a parent your job isn't to be your child's best friend. If your child winds UP being your best friend, that's a bonus. And of course Im not saying not to love your child to the moon and back and show it every minute of every day. But your job isn't to cater and pamper their every need and whim. Your job is to get them to adulthood. And lead by example. And part of that is learning there are rules and limits and expectations and boundaries. Giving them everything they want when they want isn't going to teach them to be anything but needy, helpless codependent whiners.

edit: another thing as I come back to this a few hours later. You're the parent. Don't feel the need to ever explain or justify any rule or decision to your kids. Just keep it simple. ""Sorry, we can't afford it."" What are they gonna do, audit the books? or ""No. I said no. That's all you need to know. Is no."" or... and this actually worked with my kids: ""Yep I said so. Completely arbitrary reason. Guess what. Im the adult, I get to make up arbitrary rules, Im the parent. Deal with it. When you're the adult you get to make arbitrary rules for you kids. Circle of life. Go ask grandma and grandpa they'll tell ya the same thing. They made arbitrary rules that I thought sucked when I was your age. So Im just passing the buck onto you."" <- I like this one because it shows you acknowledge the unfairness (i.e. acknowledge their pain.. shows _empathy_)... you just don't care.",i3dn243,N/A

It'd be fun to stay at the playground and slide all night long, even until tomorrow! Or maybe live at the the playground!

My parents weren't that involved with what I did in my free time (essentially screen time), so I spent most of my time playing video games. I definitely would have preferred it if they tried to  manage my time after looking backon it, but I grew out of it on own and I'm now a perfectly fine student in highschool. 

If you're not already familiar, ""Adopt Me"" is a game where kids can pretend to have families (something of the sort - in terms of appearance it's harmless). A LOT of kids play this game, and I'm pretty sure it's the most popular game on the site. This may give you some false pretenses, but if you think about it, a lot of games out there have many inappropriate ideas in the real world (i.e., shooting people), and it's essentially the same here. 

I personally think it would be extremely uncomfortable for her if you were overly assertive (like others are recommending to be) with stopping her. I think it's better to expose to her more healthy hobbies. We all have weird things we liked to participate in, but it's something that most of us tend to grow out of. Admittedly, if my parents found out about all the stuff I've seen/played, they'd think I'm crazy. But look at me now - I'm a healthy student with great grades and I look back on my past and laugh a bit. Monitor her, but most importantly don’t turn a blind eye.

There’s lots of different games and it’s mostly appropriate and censored. One area of the game that is big and why kids like it is ‘role play games’. It sounds concerning but it’s more so family games or apartment life or things like kids used to play pretend IRL with friends where ones the mommy and daddy or ones a lawyer and one is a teacher. It’s been shown to be healthy and beneficial for kids to explore this. With that said, you should discuss with her what’s appropriate and not.

1. There are many therapeutic options out there other than ABA. If your child isn't in cognitive behavioral therapy or receiving wrap around services, he should be.
2. People with ASD are concerned about ABA for many reasons. It's not really about brainwashing, but there's concern that it teaches kids to mask or 'act neurotypical' in a way that is not healthy. Historically, ABA used abusive practices. Again, there are many therapeutic options out there. ABA is not the only option.
3. Your child is 9yo. You really don't have a lot of control over what he's being exposed to outside of your home. You should simply assume he is being exposed and have a big talk with him about it. You should also come up with a strategy for this kind of issue in the future, because he's only going to be exposed to more problematic language and behavior in the future. 
4. Also, you're incorrect about people with ADHD not learning from their mistakes. They absolutely do. But impulsive behavior and lack of emotional regulation can cause people with ADHD to repeat mistakes. Also, children in general tend to repeat mistakes because they are children.
5. Does your son have a 504 or IEP? Because if he doesn't, he absolutely needs one. Also, he may need adult supervision when it comes to interacting with other children. If the school has a social skills group, he should be in it.

My son has ASD and ADHD. He's 11yo and in 5th grade. Currently, he gets cognitive behavioral therapy once every two weeks (with the option of more if he needs it), and we are currently looking at social skills groups and occupational therapy. At school, he has a 504 and we have the special education department, therapists and teachers all on the same page. He has a support network in place and as soon as any problem arises, we can nip it in the bud and have strategies in place.

Essentially, it doesn't sound your son is receiving the therapy or structure he needs to flourish at school. You both need to go to the school and start talking to therapists to get him set up in a program that will help him succeed.",it4id0s,N/A

But I think by 11, in general, kids are old enough to decide for themselves which friends to prioritize, and parents telling them they're not allowed to hang out with certain people takes away opportunities to develop their own values in friendships. That's a really valuable skill. As much as I would love to steamroll any and all mean girls out of 9F over here's way, I think that (within limits of course) there's so much to be gained from having her see on her own that some friends make you feel better about yourself than others, and having me being a loving pair of arms to run into when she's hurt instead of someone who pushes all obstacles out of her way. 

Maybe you could sit her down at a time when things are calm and say something like ""Hey, I was thinking, I don't really know Eliza very well. What are some things you like about her?"" or if you want to make it less targeted at her, maybe you could start a discussion at the dinner table about what makes someone a good friend or a bad friend, with everyone offering their views. Just providing opportunities for her to reflect ""is this someone that genuinely makes me feel good about myself?"" but not forcing her or criticizing her friends yourself. 

Another thing you could try is getting her enrolled in some other activities away from these two that can help her make new friends. Drama classes, art camp, community sports teams, whatever. Or if that's not an option you could try gently nudging her towards other friends, for example, asking, ""Hey, I was going to make pizza tonight. Would you like to invite \[peripheral friend\] over for pizza and a movie?"" 

I do think that ultimately this should be her decision, though. You can be a shoulder to lean on, you can give advice if she asks, but I probably wouldn't try to tell her what to do.",idlrr2s,N/A

Is it fair? No, not really. The mean kids should be the ones that get the consequences. Sadly, that is just not the way it works out in these situations. I wouldn't go to their parents, because like you said, they're not going to admit it.

Some moms read and work!  My sister in law is amazingly smart and scholarly.  She teaches university and does research.  Her kindergartener speaks 2+ languages and goes to conferences with her.  She’s a great mom!

Some moms craft and run and game and work full time.  My kindergartener does road races with us and helps pick out colors of yarn.  We play age appropriate games together (Pokémon, skylanders) and they learn how to be strategic and a good winner/loser.  I’m a good mom!

Moms come in all shapes and sizes: we don’t fit the cookie cutter mold of the 50s ideal mom - and that’s okay!  Your kid won’t like everything you like - and that’s okay!

I really wish my parents had made an intervention early on - it was only in my early twenties and losing my first girlfriend that I but rock bottom and realised what I had to do.

It really sounds like your son is experiencing addiction.

He needs medical help to address what is underlying and fueling his addiction.

He needs to be cut off, I would certainly seek help in the first instance as when you do cut him off all hell will break loose. 

Any action less that stopping this addiction will elicit the minimum response necessary to get you off his back so he can get right back to it - I've been there.

This is going to be hard for you, you sound like a great Dad but you need to do this to help him in the long run. I reckon I wasted 6 years of my life through my gaming addiction.",i1illws,N/A

Instead of pushing what you think he should do, but see who he is and what would be good for him. FYI certain games do have an online community. I rped for years and now write stories and talk to other writers, that's my happy place.

I’ve been a long time gamer. Started at 10 yr old. I’ve had phases where I drop gaming for years at a time but I always seem to end up back at a computer. I have the ability to literally sit for 6 -10 hours straight even at 34. It’s not a healthy habit it is 100% an addiction to escape. Not even about the games anymore. I just want to be left alone. 

Now that I am a father of 2 beautiful boys I find myself waiting until the boys and wife are asleep so I can sneak away. This has destroyed my sleep schedule and no matter how exhausted I am I still stay up until 2-3am every night just trying to get my alone time. I hope this shows how gaming can be a real issue. The stimulation from gaming is almost the same as drug use. The times i took a break from gaming before kids I found myself partying hard and fulfilling my addiction for escape in many other ways, drugs, shows, relationships. 

The reason I bring all this up is because it’s concerning. I’m a good man, I take great care of my family, house etc but I still have the itch and am constantly depressed. I think even if he hates you taking away all electronics is a great approach. He may go through withdrawals etc but at least maybe that break may show him what other avenues he can explore with your guidance. Always remember the amount of time you put into an addiction is about half the time it will take to break it.

We just started non electronic time and no screens at dinner. All electronics are charged in living room including kids phones. None in their rooms. If he is sneaky charge in your room. It will be very hard at first. But be consistent and firm. We started small 1 hour increments and have been able to increase the time. Also we turn off all electronics an hour and half before bed. They shower and read or do whatever. Also be available for hanging out or board games during that time. Eventually it will get better but you will probably have a battle for a few weeks. Also if he goes around bugging people then he doesn’t get his stuff back. He’s old enough to talk to and say what the expectations are in the family and those electronics are privileges not rights. It sucked when we got serious but it’s good now. Still have to make sure they get off but it’s worth it.

Our kids have learned to preserve data or be without it for 3/4 of the month when they use it all in one go). It may not stop them from sneaking around and playing something off-line, but we did have control of internet access. 

It's so much harder to regulate things when homework/school requires a device and internet access. The pandemic shot out screen limits all to hell, with virtual school and each kid being assigned a chrome book from school. 

I think you're right to be concerned. This sounds like addiction. My oldest is the most screen oriented, but he started coding around 11/12, and wants to develop video games. He also has other interests. The pandemic resulted in the crushing ability to pursue those, and virtual school and ADD don't mix well. So, the year of virtual schooling he nearly dropped out of high school, stayed up all night on  social media (which I'd been strict on before, but Discord became the only way to really stay in contact with his friends), and it was a mess. He was at least working during that time, which at least got him out of the house and learning some practical skills.

Thankfully, he found a path at an alternative high school for his senior year, and allowing him to explore options and make his own decision (like considering the GED, which he could have passed, but would have lost out on free two years of community college, which he would get by finishing high school in one of our city schools). But, he had a goal he really wanted, which was video game design, to fall back on to help get out of it once we returned to in person school/activities. I have loosened the screen restrictions quite a lot as my kids have gotten older, but keep my eye on other factors, like time spent on other activities, family interactions, how they treat other people in general, whether they are taking care of their own needs for food, sleep, grooming, etc. And that's where the red flags come into play.

Your kid isn't interested in family life, interacting with friends in person, or anything else. Even with his gaming/online hobby, he's not pushing himself to be better at it or learn more skills. This has all the ear marks of an addiction. I would get professional help and take some more drastic measures to detox from tech (maybe best to do in the summer when there isn't school, and after input from a therapist?).",i1j9jbf,N/A

Some reddit parents will say that this is normal and your son is just an introvert, but most doctors would disagree.

Get him into some organized activities so that he can be physically active, even if he goes kicking and screaming. Surely, there must be something outdoors that he likes. Screens are easier, but that doesn't mean there's no joy to be had in other things.

Physical activity is absolutely necessary to health and brain development. Not exercise every day for a decent amount of time at this age will set your son up for huge problems not only now, but down the road. The damage done now can't be undone as it affects how his body develops.

One is screen time and addiction. Games just like TV and books are designed to get your attention with an interesting story. And like puzzles, jigsaws and board games they're designed to make you want to keep trying to win the challenge. On top of that they have replayability and are never exactly the same each time you play it.  Young kids cannot be expected to self-regulate against this, you must set boundaries. No matter how much they beg and whine. Explain to your kids why the boundaries are important to you, but don't give in.

The other element is the online social network built into some games. Just like Facebook, your kids are messaging and talking with other people through the game. Do you know exactly who they are talking to? Just because the other person's profile says they are 10 doesn't mean it's true. 

I do let my kids play Minecraft but only on my own server that can only be accessed inside my house. So they get to do all kinds of fun things within our family world, building, sharing and problem solving. And yes after an hour they are very unhappy to be torn away. But I know what it's like and I know the feeling passes. To be honest I'd still prefer they spent their screen time playing games instead of watching the nth repeat of some animated cartoon.

With regards to media literacy, I encourage my son to ask a lot of questions when things don't make sense. This means not being afraid to say ""I don't understand."" I also ask him to explain what he's watching or playing to me, so I can gauge how he interprets the media he consumes, and help him better understand things he may overlook. 

We also talk about how people sometimes make things up (esp. on social media, YouTube) because getting more attention means they get more followers/views/money.

What your parent can do:

- Implement guided access on YouTube on the iPad, you can limit the amount of time within a certain app. My kids get 1 hr a day in YouTube. To get more they need a passcode.

- They can’t download anything so the other apps are educational. They have full use of these apps at all times.

- They whine/cry/throw a fit about the iPad getting taken away? Or the time limit? Guess who just loss iPad privileges for the rest of the day/week and stick to it 

- Show him how to play independently. He will need a lot of attention at first but gradually decrease the time spent with him until he can play independently.

- Look into sports that he can join

- Look at clubs/activities he can take part in 

- Communicate with him the consequences for his actions. Poor behavior mimicking videos he has seen? iPad gets taken away. State what he did and what is going to happen AND stick to it

https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/91w0tz/tell_me_about_roblox/,Gbro08,2018-07-26,1532583486.0,10,"Finally! something I can contribute too! I've been playing roblox since 2011, and I can tell you that the only thing that makes it inappropriate are maybe the weapons and fighting in some of the games. When characters die it usually isn't bloody but instead it's just a silly death animation with a silly sound at the end.

There ARE inappropriate things on roblox that get passed the moderators, but for your kid to find them, he would have to actively search for them. The thing about roblox is that it's not a game, it's a platform for games to be hosted on like steam. The **players** are the ones who make the games, so there are plenty of inappropriate games, BUT most of these games have hardly any players or none at all, and your kid would have to actively try to find them if he wanted to play them. There is also a chat, which I believe can be disabled, but there really isn't any need to. I have probably spent 2000+ hours playing Roblox over the years and I have never once seen anyone trying to take advantage of a child on the site. The filter is incredibly strict for those under 13 so numbers are almost always filtered out, and most swear words are too. However no filter is perfect, and users can still bypass it by saying things like ""axzshole"". So if you're childs like 5 and you don't want him to exposed to those words then you can disable chat.


I'd say that anyone at any age could play, but depending on how often your kid is exposed to swear words, he may or may not need a filter. I'd say kids should be able to chat no older then the age of 9, because by that time they already know most swear words that people use on the site.


Here's what I would recommend you do to make sure your child is safe on Roblox.

1. Tell him that it's not okay to search for or play games that he knows are inappropriate, if you want you could even make him ask you for permission to play a new game, although given how many games there are on the site, this could get annoying really fast.

2. Check his search history and also a list of the games that he has played recently. This way you will know if he has found anything inappropriate.

3. If you allow him to chat, give him the usual spiel about not giving your personal information on the internet. 



Lastly, you should know that most of the articles you see in the news in roblox are completely false and exaggerated. Roblox is starting to become a popular kids game, and these news sites are purposefully spewing out articles completely riddled with lies, designed to scare you so that they can have better ratings and draw your attention better. These sites are counting on you not knowing anything about the site. I strongly recommend you play with your kid, you'll see it really isn't so bad. In fact it's actually a lot of fun. There are plenty of games for kids but also many for adults or for all ages. So I could see the site as being something you are able to bond over.


Lastly, because I have been playing so long I have thousands of robux(the in game currency). Most games on roblox aren't pay2win, but many of the clothes in the catalog cost robux. If you want, you can send my reddit account a pm with your son's username and I am willing to give him enough robux to buy some nice clothing. ",e31y7go,N/A

You've got channels (aka like subreddits) where you can join things based on your interests, etc. I believe that once you put in a birthdate you can't change it - so if you set up her discord with her - she won't be able to access NSFW channels; but yeah - she can join channels that basically allow her to chat in a group function. 

Then you've got your DM's (private messages). You can set up her account so only her friends can private message her - and depending on your level of comfort you and her can set up rules that she can only accept friend requests from people she knows in real life/has talked to a few times on Roblox (that part I'd be a little iffy on, cause people can and do lie about their age on the internet). 

You can easily delete your own messages from Discord - but you can't delete other peoples. They have to delete their own messages. So - you could set up a rule that you are allowed to look at her discord at any time and ask her questions about what channels she's joined, any usernames you're suspicious of, if a conversation looks oddly one sided (like she's deleted messages) etc. I'd even go as far as to (at her age) log into her discord account on your computer/phone as well seeing as you can log in on multiple devices. 

I know there are a lot of problems with Discord - but they are the same problems you'd see on any other social media when it comes to kids. I think it's all about education, teaching them HOW to socialise and behave on these apps and then slowly giving them more freedom as they earn it. Like how you wouldn't immediately jump to going to Fiji for a month and leaving your kid/teen home alone - you'd (hopefully not do that at all!) work your way up to it and assess at each stage ""is my kid ready for more responsibility/freedom?""",idixwwz,N/A

I generally practice gentle parenting, but like you, I sometimes get too lenient, and then I get kinda explosive . 

My daughter literally talks from the second she wakes up to when she falls asleep, no one can stand her for more than a few minutes. So I’ll be straight with her and be like “hey, your annoying me. Can I get a little break” 

We also tell our kids we are “off duty” so I’ll go to my room and just say “moms off duty, go to your dad if you need something” 

And if I have a project I don’t want to be interrupted in (for example today I was hanging a shelf) I’ll tell the kids “hey I’m about to go hang this shelf, it will take me like 30 minutes. I’ll be off duty the whole time, only come to me if it’s an emergency”— but giving them a little heads up seems to help a lot. 

But here’s the thing, we are trying to prepare our kids for the world, and in the world, if you are being fucking annoying, people are going to get annoyed with you, and that’s just life. So I don’t think there is anything wrong with calmly saying “hey you’re bugging me, I’m working on something, I’ll check out your Roblox cars when I’m done having my own time”",i0jpj7m,N/A

My son will also check to make sure I’m watching, whether he’s playing a game or showing me a video. He also makes me answer questions to make sure I’m paying attention. If he shows me a drawing or comic and I tell him I like it, he asks what my favorite part is. 

He’s just super excited about his hobbies. He wants to share his excitement with anyone and everyone. Keep in mind that a kid like this is gonna face some social rejection, even though his interests may be popular with other kids, because he lacks the social awareness and impulse control to understand that most kids don’t make friends by info-dumping at each other. So it’s important that you teach him how to hold a proper conversation, along with how to tell if someone is bored or annoyed. Also important that you seek out places for him to share his excitement with people in an environment where his enthusiasm will be appreciated— clubs, leagues, classes, conventions, etc. The more he gets to channel his interests into opportunities for learning and social connection, the less his excitement will manifest as unwanted behavior or internal shame. 

You want to be careful not to be your kid’s first bully, either. Just because you want your kid to stop annoying you doesn’t mean you have to make them feel bad for it. Teaching a lesson in the moment should generally be avoided, because you’re likely to be impatient and your kid is already distracted. The only message they’ll be taking away is that you wanted them to stop talking. Instead, when you want to concentrate, take preventative measures: Schedule your quiet time to take place after you’ve had good quality time with your kid, tell him what to expect and for how long (“I will be unavailable to watch or comment on anything for the next 30 minutes while I concentrate on X. If it’s not an emergency, please do not interrupt. I love you and it’s important for me to have this time to focus.”), and make this a regular practice. 

Spend time practicing social interactions with your kid regularly and suggest alternatives to talking for times when it’s inappropriate— like making a video, writing, or creating something with the topic as inspiration.

When you consider screen time - the argument sometimes is that unnatural light, eye strain etc can be a problem.

But typically when people make the screen time argument - it's more related to not being outside, playing games, watching videos, bright and flashing lights. 

If this is his way to connect with his sister, I'd continue it because it's overall going to be more healthy for both of them. 

I would consider the following though:

1. Tablet time ends 2 hours before bedtime (as most will say the screen light can mess with sleeping). If they want to do a quick 2 minute say good night, ok with that, but not having him facetiming for two full hours before bedtime.
2. Have them move around - take the tablet outside, sit in the living room, walk around with it; vs just sitting in their bedroom on it. 

We live out in the country, no neighbors, my son (9) can't just walk a block and go hang out with his friends.

If you've got Netflix or Amazon Prime, they have so many shows that are actually ok to watch for both parents and kids. 
Netflix: I love Puffin Rock, Spirit, Numberblocks, Alphablocks, Octonauts, Storybots, and Word Party. None of these make me want to blow my brains out, like My Little Pony, or Blippi. Puffin Rock is legit relaxing. I've actually sat and watched that Puffin Rock without the kids for like 2 episodes before I realized they had wandered off.
Amazon Prime: Tumble Leaf, If You Give A Mouse A Cookie, Pete the Cat, The Stinky and Dirty Show. There's even more if you spring for the PBS channel. Tumble Leaf is also a decently relaxing show. 
Disney has Bluey, which I've heard is really good.
None of these shows have anything scary in them. There are some tense moments if your kid is sensitive, but nothing frightening. No monsters, no scary people. Just stuff like, ""How do we help the baby seal down from the ledge so she can get to dinner?"" And, ""How do we call for a lift from across the lake?"" Or, ""How do we jump from here to there?""",hjm9rom,N/A

There’s always going to be kids like this around whether they’re rich, or not. There’s literally no escaping it. You have to teach your daughter how to ignore these statements, and to not engage. The moment she gives away that this bothers her, the more they’ll do it. 
So she needs to stop trying to be friends with those kids. If she lets them bully her any longer without standing up for herself, I promise you they’ll never stop. 
So, my advice is to teach her how to stand up for herself, and explain to her that there’s always going to be people who think they’re better than you. 
The reality is that these bullies just aren’t good people who are miserable in their life, so they have to make other people feel bad too. 
Help her with her feelings, and explain to her that these spoiled kids are like this due to all the freedom their parents have given them at such a young age. Try to explain to her that they always got what they wanted, and have probably never been told NO so it made them mean, ungrateful, and hard to be around. 
I would just remind her that nice things aren’t important because at the end of the day stuff is just stuff, and when that’s taken away you are left with just yourself. 
Keep reminding her that being a kind person, and treating people how you want to be treated IS IMPORTANT. I hope this helps.",hugh8gr,N/A

She doesn't have to listen to them to know who she is, that she is valued and loved, and from what I've read, way more than some of those other kids.  Maybe help her find other groups to find friends in.  Is there a gaming group in town? Is there a sport she likes, does she play an instrument, dancing, or some other hobby?

And I so agree with the entitled little shits comment.  Though I try to remind myself these kids face their own struggles that manifest for various reasons, I still have moments I would like to punt them to the moon. Do you have any tips on how she might better be able to stand up to them?

We never wanted her to be a bully, or brag about the things we have.  My husband and I both grew up very poor, but think we learned so many valuable lessons in those hard times that we wanted to make sure our children understand those same things.  But maybe we have failed to teach her that there are people out there who will do exactly that.  We are really focusing right now on making sure her self esteem is on a solid foundation.  It just takes a lot to make her angry enough to fight back, and she tends to just feel sad about it.

I have spent so much time researching on the impact screens have at a young age, it’s just something I feel very strongly about.  

Honestly I feel a bit bad for these kids, because I really feel like they are being set up to fail in many ways and it’s really not their fault at this age that they have no boundaries or that they just get pawned off on a tablet so the parents don’t have to parent.  I tried to explain to her that acting older isn’t cool by using the example of myself and asking if I tried to act older by using a walker or cane if it would be cool, that we just need to celebrate the age we are because it’s the only time we will ever be that age again.  Sometimes I think maybe I’m asking her to try to understand concepts that are impossible to comprehend with the amount of big emotions she is experiencing, and I try to remind myself that when you are that age, school and friends make up the bulk of her life.  

I will also try and do a better job of embracing her likes more.  I mean I support them and while I can recognize a few characters she likes - I am by far not the anime expert she is.  Maybe by involving myself in it more she won’t need to rely as much on friends validation of it and they can bond on other shared interest.

School right now itself is kind of weird because of COVID.

Bullies acquire authority but never moral legitimacy. They know their power is unjust and fragile. I think if she states facts, says it like it is, then it’s not being a bully. It’s just the truth. Whatever mean thing they have to say to her she can always say something like, “ You are a bully and I’m not afraid of you. You make fun of me because you have nicer things than I do, but I feel sorry for you. I hope you find peace in your heart, and learn to love yourself. Misery loves company. Your words don’t bother me. I love my family, and everything they have given me.“

Something along those lines. 
Teach her to be more confident by practicing scenarios with her. Give her more than one response she can use. Tell her what they are saying isn’t true, and they are just getting under her skin. Teach her to ignore it.

The more she responds in this manner I think they will get bored, and move on eventually.

Long answer: Just to normalize what you’re deadline with, few of my students actually like to practice — it’s a discipline and one that can take a while to really learn and feel at ease with. The trick, in my opinion, is finding the music that is so rewarding to learn that you forget you’re practicing. I was one of these kids and went on to get a college degree in music, so also, your child’s dedication can change over time. 

About her not wanting to perform: that too may change over time. Public performance is like public speaking — it’s hard!! There’s a reason you have to learn how to do it. Music doesn’t have to be performative, though it is expressive. If she liked to paint but didn’t do gallery shows, would you tell her to put down her brushes, or if she wrote poetry and didn’t share it with others, would you call it a waste of time? 

You say she likes her teacher, which goes a long way, in my opinion. If you haven’t already, I’d suggest sharing with her teacher what you’ve shared here — the teacher may have some creative ideas for how to help your child break through some of this totally normal reluctance to practice.

I think a little skepticism on media reporting of these kinds of trends is warranted. As a teen I remember walking in on my mom watching some tv news report on “lipstick parties” where girls were supposedly going down on boys while wearing different lipstick to create a rainbow effect? She looked at me in horror but also disbelief to ask if kids actually did this. Of course the answer was no (and I also disdainfully informed her that we all wore lip gloss and not lipstick anyway). Did someone somewhere do this once? Maybe. But thinking it through for one moment reveals all the many reasons it would make no sense. This one isn’t as absurd or upsetting but I do believe it is (consciously or not) being used by the media to drive uproar and therefore audience engagement. 

In my opinion, the way to stay on top of things is to monitor your own kid’s social media (which it sounds like you already do). Because a tiktok algorithm could pull them toward fun dances, or stupid challenges, or sports highlight clips, or violent misogyny and racism.

IMHO it is absolutely worth his time and effort to be an active father to both children, regardless of how many hours a week he is with either.

I know it feels unbalanced, and it probably is unbalanced. I think the best think you can do is put the wedding on hold, and invest in couple’s counseling. Get clear on what your relationship needs to look like to satisfy both of you.

I bet it could help her a lot with processing divorce/blended family stuff. It’s possible she knows more than you realize that something was off in your marriage to your ex, because teenagers pick up on that stuff. So that would be a good thing for a therapist to help her talk through. And with covid on top of everything, it’s probably just making life feel a lot harder than it normally would.

I know this will sound vague but I think the biggest thing is just showing you’re there for her and available to talk - ie, if she needs emotional support she can “pull you off the shelf” and seek your help, and then put you “back on the shelf” when she feels better and wants to go back to being an independent teenager who ignores her parents, and back and forth - I think with most teens they go through both of those phases a lot. They want freedom but they also want to know that you are right there if they need something.

First, we have daily chores. So, it doesn’t matter if you would prefer to be in your virtual world in your room. You have to come out and do your chores. 

Second, we try to create opportunities to do some things that are cool and fun and competitive!!  We have one kid who really likes sports. And, she will leave her room to go play softball any day. We have another kid who likes to go outside, as long as somebody’s outside with him.

Third, we encourage some of the non-gaming behavior. We found out that two of our kids like to go on walks around the neighborhood and talk to each other. So, we adopted it, made it kind of a rule. Hey guys, it’s time to go on your walk. And, they do",h2dw7z2,N/A

At first, I popped in to see what others might have to say. I've worked with children for a long time and yet to have any of my own. So, I've only really seen this sort of thing from an educator's/nanny's perspective.  


What I can say is that I've seen a side where the child was supported, whether it was a ''phase' or not. I'm starting to feel these days that it sometimes could be one or the other, but one cannot really know for certain until they go through it with the child.  


But I feel that regardless of if it's a phase or a blooming self-aware identity, you are on the right track of being as supportive as a parent can be. As long as you are avoiding shaming or degrading tone/actions, I feel that he will benefit the most.  


As I don't have children, I tend to talk to a LOT of people. When it comes to people that have gone through such an experience I ask questions and really try to listen.   


As far as towing this line of support from you, from what I've learned, the best you can do and really all he can use positively is just that. Support. We all know there is no handbook or status quo. But for the most part, we get an idea if we really think about ''What if we were in their position?'' So, when he comes to you to vent, to ask a question or get feedback, or if he just wants to REALLY show off his excitement of a new style he is investing time in, remember to see HIM and to love him. I feel this is the best guide. For he's being true to himself and it sounds like he's on a way of really knowing who he is. This is only really nurtured through love, patience, and support.  


I'm sure one day he may ask detailed questions as to why he is different from his parents, the other children, ect. Or perhaps he won't. But he'll remember that you were in his corner the whole time, no matter what. Keep doing what you instinctively, TRUELY know what is right. I'm sure it won't steer you wrong, even if sometimes it seems uncertain.  


Best of luck!",gxzyj86,N/A

He plays lego, or on the swings, or whatever! They ""talk"" for hours at a time.

She doesn't just watch though. She often pretends to be an announcer when he's being physical ""This is it ladies and gentleman! X is trying to jump from the couch to the chair! Can he do it? Will he SURVIVE!??"" And he eats it up. If he's doing lego, she might ask what he's building and then look up facts about something he mentions. She'll shower him with info about megalodon while he's building one from lego. She sings him songs, or gives him suggestions of songs to ask Alexa to play - then watches him dance party. She buys two of some coloring books and she'll color ""with"" him on the same page, then they compare.

In the end, for my son, it is about having someone care what he's doing and give him that undivided attention. She doesn't pepper him with questions. She participates in HIS play.

She’s high functioning autistic, has adhd, anxiety and depression. She threatened to harm herself at school one day and I had to bring her to a crisis center where they sent her three hours away to a Psychiatric facility for 16 days. It was One of the hardest times of my life. When she finally got home she was A LOT better. One thing she came to realize and told us was she didn’t truly want to harm or kill herself. That her emotions were so strong in the moment she felt that way but wouldn’t have done it but that because her emotions were so strong she didn’t know how to express it any other way. Maybe your daughter is seriously and in that case maybe some in patient therapy would be a good idea. Sit down and talk with her, ask her if she truly means it , and if she does that in patient therapy is something you’re going to consider. Like my daughter , maybe she just has really strong emotions and that’s how she expresses them. So talk to her about how to express them in a different way ?! Idk if anything I’ve said will help in any way at all but I’ve been there and still go through a lot with my daughter.

I definitely don’t recommend so much screen time for kids his age. There are real world, physically/mentally stimulating ways to show him how to entertain himself with his imagination or to play together. 

• Reading together

• listening to music and having a dance-off

• creating something together like paper planes with a penny to affect pitch

• Each if you draws a picture, and you pass them to each other to color however you want.

• Make a big loose scribble and have him decide what it looks like. He then takes a thick marker and outlines the thing he sees in the scribble and colors it.

• You can take turns drawing and the other person guesses what it is.

• Make a boat with a rubber band and pieces of wooden popsicle stick to twist in it to propel the boat forward in the bath and have a boat race

• You can make a cardboard fort and draw furniture around in it, or make a blanket fort and tape paper cutout furniture in it

• Write a story together sentence by sentence (each of you switching back and forth so it’s written together and can lead anywhere)!

• Maybe play “Lava” in the living room, or find more board or card games to play.

You definitely want to get his body moving every day which will release Endorphins, the “feel good” hormones. If he tuckers himself out each day, he’ll sleep better and it can help reduce his funk.

I totally support his gaming, especially since it includes socializing, but being stationary in front of a screen for so long can breed depression and can lead to him losing sight of how to help himself feel better when gaming doesn’t always  “fix” the funk when he’s older.",goppgbi,N/A

For example I take my daughter out to the park around 11am, donut shops around 10am, certain stores when I know they’ll be empty. Your kids are also older so they’re able to wear a mask so that’s great, opens up a bunch of things to do. We also do a lot of hiking, arts and crafts.

It’s easy for us adults to adjust because we understand that there is a pandemic but we really just uprooted our kids lives, school stopped, socializing stopped basically the normal stopped.

Things like role playing, reading stories, creating your own story together about a particular behaviour you want to see. You’ve said no complaining, being negative, arguing back- but what can he do in these situations when he is feeling angry/upset instead and focus on teaching that. It’s ok to feel angry/upset but how do we manage these emotions? All a punishment does is shut down the feeling and give no strategy on how to actually manage the feeling.

Sending him to his room for 1-2 hours is a long time for an 8 year old so I’d think about the end goal of doing this. Is the purpose to punish him? To act as a re-set? To give you a break? To give him time to regulate his emotions? A mixture of all of the above? Say for example the goal is for him to regulate his emotions- he may not know how to actually do this by himself so sending him to his room alone might not be the most effective strategy here long term, even if it is effective at shutting him down in the short term.",h8de2cg,N/A

You're training an AI robot, or trying to control a train that if it deviates from your path is considered a derailment.

>complaining when he doesn't get what he wants, making fun/negativity and being argumentative.

For complaining, and one thing I feel needs to be pointed out, is when you (parent) don't get your way, you punish him. You punishing him for complaining about not getting is way, is in fact you complaining about not getting your way. Instead of words or whining, you use actions against your son. Now, of course it isn't possible (in my mind anyway) to never punish your child. However, when he starts to complain are you asking for more details on why he feels he should get to do what he wants, and then you explain your point to his. Basically, is there an opportunity for him to complain, that you'll actively listen to him for, prior to punishment.

Making fun / being negative I feel is testing boundaries. I doubt you'll be able to squash it all, but if he makes a remark that you don't agree with are you asking him why he felt that comment was appropriate and then explaining why it wasn't?

Being argumentative is apart of growing up. Again, not a robot but a human with their own set of emotions, thoughts, enjoyments, frustrations. What might seem small to you because of your life and experience may be very large to your son.

>""I am never getting my iPad back, I CAN'T do it (meaning he can't change his behavior, he'll say he can't help it), life doesn't matter,""

This makes me feel he isn't being listened to, and that he is just expected to follow what you say. He can't not because he won't, but because it isn't him right now in this instant. He needs the guidance, communication, and support from his parents, but all he is getting is punishment.

Now, again, this could be me misinterpreting what is written here because it's impossible to sum up your entire parenting style in four paragraphs. If this doesn't apply to you, sorry. If it resonates with you at all, awesome.

We will tell him it's okay to be upset but he can't be rude to us. And we have talked about managing his emotions with different thoughts or behaviors. He knows deep breathing, talking to himself in a different way, he will ask for us to listen to what he has to say and we will. Going to the room often is for him to reset but honestly sometimes its used as a consequence when he is being extremely rude. If he asks me to come talk to him I will go in there and talk-if he is ready to discuss we do that... if he calls me in to continue telling me how angry he is at me and that I am mean, etc. I tell him we can talk later as I have already heard that before sending him to his room.

&#x200B;

It is a long time. I actually hoped I wouldn't have to send him to his room but I tried it at one point and sometimes the time alone helps him. If he gets even more dysregulated then I will go in there if I think it might help. (like if he is crying and asking for me; but if he is angry screaming I will leave him to himself for a few-this doesn't happen often maybe once/month).",h8dhqgx,h8de2cg

We can definitely be hypocritical as parents! I do tell him that we aren't allowed to be rude to him either and to let us know if we are. By complaining I mean - for example- when I ask him to go shower which he knows darn well is the routine he makes a rude noise and rolls his eyes at me. This is not okay with us. Of course it will happen every now and then but not okay as often as he does it. He likes to eye roll, make a rude noise of disgust - those are the things we aren't okay with when we are asking nicely for him to do something that is an expectation on him. But saying he is tired, bored, doesn't like school work -stuff like this- is absolutely okay as he is expressing things we all feel. So I should say its more about being rude to us. By complain I mean when we are going somewhere/doing something that isn't his first choice he might say ""This is SO boring"" with disgust and annoyance. I don't feel it's okay for him to complain like that when we are trying to enjoy ourselves. He needs to have empathy for other people's experiences in my view and learn to suppress annoyance at times. 

By negative I mean like he says dumb 8 year old stuff like I couldn't get into a website my password wasn't working and he just laughed at me like he found it amusing that I was struggling, that kind of thing. Or he will fart almost in my face, or burp over and over again when I have asked him not to. Again, not every once in a while none of us are perfect. It's just not very kind and super annoying.

We have asked him why he does stuff. A lot of the times he thinks its funny and for an 8 year old it is funny; sometimes we totally validate it that if he's around his friends and they all think its funny fine, other times we say ""It's not funny to make fun of someone who is struggling"". 

We really try and give him a path for what being kind, etc. looks like but I agree it's extremely important. On the other hand I also like something I read a long time ago I think in 1-2-3 Magic that you don't need to explain things over and over to kids in fact it can do the opposite in trying to reason/discuss. So sometimes its a hard no. But really hard to balance sometimes!! 

I know what we can work on is being more patient with him. And we also get frustrated easily (not major like road rage but we do get annoyed for sure) and I am sure as much as we try to ""hide"" it from him (meaning keep adult discussions away from him) he sees our own struggles at times. He also sees us deep breathing and trying to relax..

These chores need to be completed correctly, to the same standard you'd apply to yourself. Of course, acknowledge you will probably need to show her how to do new chores.

Personally, I’d go cold turkey. Put all the devices away and plan an entire day out. Distract him and then when you get home (if/when he asks) “we’re taking a break from devices as a family. Let’s choose something else to do.” Then do it. Go for a walk, play a board game, do whatever he asks. You should also lead by example and limit your devices. Write up a list of things to do other than devices (draw, library, swim, stem project, etc). Eventually you can decide if/when to reintegrate devices.

Which would be fine if it wasn't weighing on you, but it clearly is. When do you guys even have dinner, or do chores, homework, or any of those things?

&#x200B;

I don't have multiple children and my son is quite young, but I don't spend that much time playing with my kid. Or maybe that's not quite accurate to say because I feel my necessary care time (dressing, feeding...) is quite playful. We also walk/bike home from daycare which also translates to a solid hour of outside fairly playful time. I'm basically buying the notion that ""quality time"" can occur during basic care tasks, as long as we do those tasks with our full focus on our child (which I don't always, but I try to keep it in mind). If I have to spend 30mn with my kid and we also need to get dressed, I'll take 30mn goofing off while getting dressed over efficient dressing and then dedicated playing time every time. I also feel that children and adults just play very differently, and child play is such an important activity and one that adults just aren't very well-suited to. Not to say children and adults shouldn't play together, but that playing with an adult cannot fully replace or substitute for playing with other kids or solo play. I think you need them all as part of a complete breakfast. In other words, I think that while my child deserves my time and attention and care, I think it's appropriate for a minority of that time and attention and care to occur during dedicated play activities.

&#x200B;

Your children are older so it's not quite the same situation; they need less physical care and their play is closer to adult play than a toddler's is. But I think the general principle still applies. I asked when you guys even have dinner or do chores, because those can also be opportunities for together time, with the benefit that you're getting stuff done (chores, homework) or it's time you'd have to spend with them anyway (dinner). What activities do you enjoy, that you might engage in if you weren't spending 3 hours playing every evening? Some of those I'm sure would be pure ""relax away from the kids"" stuff, but some are maybe things you can do with one or more of your kids - more together time, but you're bringing the kid(s) into your world instead of vice-versa.

&#x200B;

>I’m exhausted but I see it as - I brought them into the world, and it   
would be really crappy to not give them the best experience I can.

It sounds like you're doing that! I don't mean with the playing, I mean in general. I think it's worth considering your own burnout level - there is definitely a tradeoff where we do need to make sacrifices for our children, but it's also true that our children will have a better experience if we aren't completely miserable. Certainly playing with someone is more enjoyable if they're totally into it, and aren't checked out or trying hard to be into it but struggling internally. I'm sure there's always going to be a percentage of the time when we give our children our attention but it's draining and we don't get that much out of it (it certainly happens a lot with me), but I think it's worth finding ways of minimizing that percentage, and trying to increase the quality time that we get something out of.",h08l5eg,N/A

It sounds like your daughter can retain information fine and is completely happy to learn. It sounds like she is incredibly averse to learning or doing anything school-related, which is not the same thing. I've heard of Roblox but am not particularly familiar with it; does she make games on it or can you see that she plays it in a particularly mindless way? Generally children do have a drive to learn, they just might not apply it to the things we think they should (or know they should given what they'll need to know and do as adults). Can you identify activities where your daughter does exhibit motivation, creativity, an ability to retain information, even use some basic skills she doesn't use academically like reading, writing or counting? If so, maybe listing those for yourself and using them to remind yourself that your daughter is a capable person with (at least some) skills and qualities could help you feel a bit better. Your view of the situation and of your daughter seems to be very negative, even despairing in your post, and that might not only be painful for you it might also affect your daughter. Also if you do identify channels where your daughter does seem to thrive and learn it could help give ideas on how to help her do better in school in general (and I say ""give ideas"" in the most tentative way possible; whatever you actually end up doing I think you'd want to be careful you don't ""contaminate"" things she loves with the taint of ""school"", which it sounds like she hates to an almost pathological extent. I also think it's worth separating knowing things in general with doing well at school: one can theoretically be very good with skills in certain contexts, but be completely unable to apply them in a school setting. If your daughter got to that point it wouldn't be ideal, doing well at school is important, but it would still be better than not knowing the things at all. And ""translating"" one's knowledge into schoolwork is a different problem from learning the things to begin with).

I'm sorry your mother calls you a failure; of course it is never easy when our child has difficulties and it can be hard to silence the voices saying it's our fault, especially when it's people we love and respect literally telling us this. But you're not a failure, you seem to be trying to do your best by your daughter.",ggmrx29,N/A

I was going to suggest a second opinion, but I guess you're kind of stuck either way if there's no way to get her evaluated right now.  I still wouldn't punish her though.  If anything it will make her hate school and learning even more.  I know you said you have tried apps and programs already, so my next thought since she likes roblox was maybe trying to find a game that involves simple math for her to play, but I'm sure you've already tried that.  

I'm not sure what kind of math 3rd graders are doing these days, so I'm referring to the Khan Academy 3rd grade math course for ideas.  Maybe instead of sitting and doing worksheets you could try to make it visual or tactile, like cutting a circle into pieces to show fractions, or using pompoms or something else small to do adding/subtracting/division/multiplication, making big shapes out of tape on the floor and using a ruler to measure to teach perimeter and area, using different sized measuring cups and colored water to teach volume, etc.  Maybe if you can make it fun and engaging she can learn the concepts more easily and won't be as upset about completing her work when she understands it better?

For reading/writing maybe try to go with her interests - if she really loves horses for example, find books about horses or kids horseback riding, and read with her alternatingpages or paragraphs.  For writing, you could find some simple writing prompts and take turns writing sentences to make a story, then maybe even have her draw some pictures and get it printed and you could read that together too.  Try to follow her interests as much as possible and engage her as much as you can.  

School may still be a sticking point, but I know that kids who feel they have fallen behind often end up hating school because they don't understand the concepts and feel like they're not good enough.  Maybe if you can help her to build up her skills she will be more able to keep up in school and end up hating it less.  It must be very intimidating to her to sit down with you with a paper in front of her of things she doesn't understand and be told she needs to finish the work on it before she can do what she enjoys.  Try to make learning fun for her, but also hopefully you can get her evaluated sometime soon since there probably is some underlying issue that is making this so hard for her.

It’s nice to believe that children will be responsible and it’s great when they step up but a puppy takes a lot of work. Depending on its age, you’ll have to toilet train it (imagine a baby who can bark and walk but not contain their bladder) and crate train it and then do obedience classes. This is all in order to have a happy, healthy, well trained adult dog. Only be ready to commit to a puppy if you and your husband are ready to assume all of the responsibilities (even though it sounds like your children are awesome and will try to help). 

Also, depending on the breed, you’re looking at a lifetime commitment to an animal. So 10 years give or take. Are you ready for that? It’s not fair to bring an animal home and then return them after a period of time because it didn’t turn out the way you expected. 

If not a puppy, consider perhaps adopting a 1-2 year old dog.

No, that is not how this works. That's not how any of this works. [**This article**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/opinion/transgender-children-medical-bills.html) has a pretty good overview of why. [**Psychology Today has one too**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/202008/three-popular-myths-about-transgender-youth). Among other things, reconstructive surgery is not an option until the patient is in their late teens or early 20's. This is surgery that works best on a body that is already fully grown.

Transition is absolutely necessary to keep many trans kids alive. Without transition a hell of a lot of them commit suicide. When able to transition rates of suicide attempts drop to the national average. This is very literally life saving medical care. 

The *""90% desist""* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth. The [**American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines**](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) for the treatment of trans and GNC youth cover the origins of this myth, why it has been debunked, and what the actual best treatment is.

For preadolescents transition is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is 100% temporary puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will ""desist"" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.

Any competent doctor with a basic grasp of this topic should recognize that transition is vitally necessary, frequently life saving medical care for trans adolescence. And that if there is even a chance that an adolescent may be trans, there is absolutely no reason to withhold 100% temporary and fully reversible hormone blockers to delay puberty for a little while until they're sure.

According to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/), but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes the gender expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The genders of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156). That said, many trans people also don't express their gender until much older. This is a difficult situation to articulate, and most children aren't given the language or tools with which to articulate what they're experiencing. Between this and the intense social pressure to be cis, many aren't able to verbalize their identity until they are older.

Regarding treatment for trans youth, [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines from the AAP. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender, and some of those young kids are trans. A child who is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their appearance can suffer debilitating distress over this conflict.

When this happens transition is the treatment recommended by every major medical authority. For young children this process is purely social; it consists of allowing the child to express their gender identity as comes naturally to them. If they just have gender atypical interests or clothing preferences, let them have the toys and clothes they want. If they want to use a name or pronouns atypical to the gender they were previously assumed to be, let them do that too. If they later decide they don't want to do this anymore, nothing has been changed that can't be changed back in an afternoon. Let the child explore their gender, there's no reason not to.

For adolescents, the first line of medical intervention is puberty delaying treatment. This treatment is 100% temporary and fully reversible; it does nothing but buy time by delaying the onset of permanent physical changes. This treatment is very safe and well known, because it has been used for decades to delay puberty in children who would have otherwise started it inappropriately young. If an adolescent starts this treatment then realizes medical transition isn't what they need, they stop treatment and puberty picks up where it left off. There are no permanent effects, and it significantly improves trans youth's mental health and [**lowers suicidality**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/01/21/peds.2019-1725).

But if an adolescent starts this treatment, socially transitions (or continues if they have already done so), and by their early/mid-teens they still strongly identify as a gender atypical to their appearance at birth, the chances of them changing their minds later are basically zero. At that point hormone therapy becomes an option, and even that is still mostly reversible, especially in its early stages. The only really irreversible step is reconstructive genital surgery and/or the removal of one's gonads, which isn't an option until the patient is in their late teens at the earliest. 

This specter of little kids being pressured into transition and rapidly pushed into permanent physical changes is a complete myth. It just isn't happening. And this fear-mongering results in nothing except trans youth who desperately do need to transition being discouraged and prevented from doing so. Withholding medical treatment from an adolescent who desperately needs it is not a neutral option.

The only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/#.pqspdcee0). When prevented from transitioning about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)

Transition [**vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts**](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2), and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets. The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the [**largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/).

Regarding chances of ""transition regret"", this incredibly rare. It is vastly more common for trans people to regret *not* being able to start transition-related treatment in adolescence, sparing them the trauma and damage of being forced through an inappropriate puberty, than it is for people to transition as adolescents and later regret it.

Of everyone who starts transition, event eh most preliminary stages of trying a new name or pronouns, only about 8% of detransition, and of those who do 62% go on to transition again later - meaning only 3% detransiton permanently. And among those who do detransition, nearly all cited external factors as their reasons for doing - e.g., intolerable levels of anti-trans harassment or discrimination (31%), employment discrimination (29%), and pressure from a parent (36%), spouse (18%), or other family members (26%).

I will say this: you child obviously trusts you. They are talking to you about their gender and sexuality, which means you have created an environment where they are comfortable being themself. Kudos for that!
I’d say, let them take the lead. Let them dress how they want, let them use the pronouns they want, but also let them know that you are here to support their experimentation with gender, and that you will also be happy to switch pronouns again if they find he/him pronouns don’t fit them. 
One final note, 9 is a bit young for an AFAB trans or non-binary person to come out. This is because AFAB people aren’t pushed into gender boxes as much as AMAB people are, so until puberty (11-14) they don’t usually experience a lot of dysphoria or discomfort. I would visit a doctor and find exactly how far along your child’s puberty is. I went through puberty at 9 years old as well, and it was so hard to be feeling with body hair and pads while my friends were playing with barbies. My early puberty actually left me disabled, with a back fracture. 
You can ask your child and your pediatrician about puberty blockers, even for just a few years, so your child can have a chance to explore and be a kid.

I can definitely relate, in fact I made a post about it on here. The school systems are shoving curriculum down everyone's throat, the kids and adults alike are going stir crazy because nobody is used to being shut in for such a period of time, and without school and play time the kids have more energy than ever. It doesn't make you a bad father, but it is an adjustment that needs to be made.

I'm not preaching by any means because I'm not there either lol. I'll be damned if my kid gets any school work done through the week because I'm working still, and her mom won't follow through with school work. 

My best advice is to set up a specific schedule, and if you are available during the hours the kids are usually in school it works. Their little brains are programmed to be learning during that time. Don't overload them though because you aren't a teacher, you don't get paid to teach. Do what you can, and what they can.

I set alarms when its time for school work. Like one alarm at 10am and we do like an hour and a half. Then at like 2pm do another hour and a half. Honestly we both give up early almost every day, but I'm not a teacher lol. 

If I said a lot of kids were eating proper balanced healthy diets I'd be full of it. I wouldn't stress too much about that. They do gotta eat, and when they can eat healthy its good, but as long as they're eating something. (A helpful tip i learned on here is get a sticker of their favorite character and put it on the box. I tried it, and it works like a charm) just imagine batman chicken thighs lol.

Lastly, brushing of teeth is probably the most important thing you mentioned lol. Electric toothbrushes are entertaining for them, and tasty toothpaste just makes them want to eat it. (But they're eating lol) in all honesty nobody is giving their kids a daily bath, and all that while they're just sitting at home.

First, the cellphone... My 12yo is the same way. Most of her friends are the same way. I'm not sure it's really a phone addiction as much as just not having a hobby. Before she got her phone, she was just bored all the time - she's not a big reader, she doesn't like coloring, she doesn't like crafts, she doesn't play with toys alone... Sometimes she'll watch some Netflix but that's not really that different, is it?

But I try to see it another way too... You're on Reddit right now. I'm on Reddit right now. I play video games, I watch Netflix... Ok I read at night, but I can't focus to read during the day either. When I was a kid... I played video games and watched TV too...

Add to that the whole lockdown thing and they can't go out and play with friends (my son plays video games with his friend, my daughter bikes etc).

That being said - a big problem I've seen with cellphones is that it seems that everyone's attention span is getting shorter... maybe that's just me... but again, if you think she spends too much time on her phone and doesn't do her chores, you're the adult, take it away (I do that too). Or take the phone at night and give it back in the morning when the chores are done.

The attitude thing - I have the same problem, same with getting them to get up in the morning etc... so I don't really have an answer unfortunately...

Yes, I think you need to start setting limits with her phone. She's having the 12 year old equivalent of tantrums because she knows you'll give in. Do not let her do this. Being a parent to a pre-teen or teenager is all about picking your battles, and there are some things to let go: what she wears, how much she eats, when she takes a shower, what books she reads. But in nearly every scientific study of screen time on the developing brain, it's shown to be almost universally bad. Clearly it's having a negative effect on her quality of life and her ability to be productive, and she as a 12 year old isn't mature enough to see this for herself. This is a battle you as her parent should fight.

12 is very young to have a smartphone. Most experts say to give your kid a flip phone or no phone at all until 8th grade. I get that we're in a time when she can't see her friends in person as often, but I think letting her do zoom calls with her friends on your phone when you're home isn't too much to ask. I'd say nip this in the bud. 1-2 hours per day is plenty of screen time for a 12 year old. In fact, I'd say 2 hours is generous. This is an awesome excuse to steer her towards doing more analog activities. The phone is coming to work with you during the day, and you're letting her use it after dinner and taking it back 2 hours later. And do this all summer. I promise you that as soon as you give her unlimited time with the phone, you'll be right back where you started. Let's face it. Phones are fun, and games like Minecraft are designed to make you never want to stop playing. But they inhibit your child's ability to spend her summer doing things that can actually stimulate her mind, like reading or drawing or playing with siblings or pets. You bought the phone. You pay the phone's service. This is YOUR phone that you have so kindly offered to let her use. You mention that she has plenty of other activities she can do at home that don't involve screens. I promise that when all of our kids are on the psychiatrist's couch in 10 years, ""My mom only let me play Minecraft for an hour and a half a day when I was 12"" will not come up (I'm joking of course haha).

I'd also recommend you take a look at the book *How to Talk so Teens Will Listen, and How to Listen so Teens Will Talk.* Awesome read on how to communicate effectively with your girl in this stage.

Stay calm and firm. Don't give in to her dramatics, and don't let her bait you into arguing or yelling. The opportunity to spend a summer mostly away from screens developing her interests in other areas really is something she'll thank you for as an adult.",fsnnyiq,N/A

""You may have your phone from X to Y time, if all your chores have been done."" And make sure she knows what you mean by 'done'. Cat box scooped and the trash with the cat patties in it taken to the can outside. Dishes in the dishwasher and put away when dry. Laundry folded and put neatly in the drawers, not crammed in balls. 

If she likes to listen to music while drawing, cool! Get a Google home she can ask to play her play list. Give her a radio. They still make MP3 players. If she can't wake herself up, a clock radio is great for that. 

As for the dog, sit her down, write down what it looks like to take care of the dog, and tell her she has one week. If she can't do it, that's okay, then the dog will be sent to a husky rescue where he can be appropriately rehomed. If there is a Humane Society accessible to you, sometimes they do low cost spay/neuter. That's how I got my cats fixed. 

You do have to be the bad guy with her. Because you are her parent. I read you said she's going through some trauma, and that doesn't meant that boundaries go out the window.
