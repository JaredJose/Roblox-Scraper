I love the platform and I love the idea of being able to create your own unique experiences and sharing them with people with the same interests.

This game is something special and I am sure it is one of the biggest idea of the recent years for the gaming industry.

I am a programmer myself, so I naturally gravitate to this type of games, where the developers encourage players to create and learn different computer science skills, be it basic, or advanced (there are some really impressive stuff people have done using this engine).

My kids and I love this game, we play some servers together and enjoy customizing characters and building our own worlds.

Sadly, my wife and I are concerned about how the age rating is managed because some unapproved worlds/servers are really children friendly, but there's obviously more mature content on the platform. And I hate the fact that restricting my kids accounts will remove the fun for them (specially the older one), adding to that, it's pretty annoying having to remove and reactivate restrictions because they want to play a disneyland server and I not wanting them to get near worlds like [Elmira](https://www.roblox.com/games/7506230120/ELMIRA-Horror).

I could block certain words from the browser they use to play roblox, but they have multiple devices and that would take too much effort as well.

Why can't devs enable a parental filter using tags and give parents the option to block certain tags they don't want their children to see?

It is really not that hard, and it would take very little effort, so please consider it, young children deserve diversity, freedom and safety as well.

Kind regards.",t5_2rnsh,144,0.99

One of its features is it allows people to actually share their exact location on a ‚Äúsnapmap.‚Äù

The person who said their snapchat user in the Chat, I added him. It was exactly what I thought. It was a creepy, disgusting guy looking to find little kids to talk to. (I was on a fake account) And going back to the map, if your kid has snapchat, please make sure their snapmap is turned off and monitor your kids online activity. If you don‚Äôt know how to turn off your kids snapmap, search up a tutorial on YouTube. Yes, sadly this isn‚Äôt the only problem on Roblox but I just wanted to address another issue some parents don‚Äôt know.

There is no space for people like this in our world. Keep monitoring your children‚Äôs media use. Please stay safe. It was actually very scary talking to the guy. He said things any creep would say.

I sacrificed my sanity and my time just so I could play the final battle, Oh wait. My parents won't let me stay up even though I let them know at least a week in advance (because of the delays)

So I woke up the next day and I see that not many people have completed but because I missed all the streams and nobody posted guides.

After a while, I started to figure out all the steps, some of which were ridiculously hard to figure out by yourself. Then, by the time I'm at the final battle against JP, with having completed everything previously at 17 fps, my fps drops to 10, and I see that around 5k players have gotten the gold crown, which was what I was aming for. Also at around this time was when the first guides started popping up which, sadly I didn't need. And then I found out there was parkour. 

That was it.  Game Over.

Ggs to all who got the gold crown and hood. 

I might try to get the crown post nerf, but this event didn't work out for me.

Solid 10/10 for the experience though but I was playing on mobile so I couldn't see all the good stuff.

My cousins and sister's accounts were being breached, so in fear of having my account breached, I created a parental pin. This was 3 years ago. Yes, I should have created a 2FA key; but, I did not want to go through the hassle of linking up all that jizz. My account age is <13, and my 10-year-old self decided to change the date to the date I created my account; it was created around 2012-2014. 

Now it's 2023, and I completely forgot the Pin. Roblox refuses to reset as they, ""do not reset pins upon user request"". Which is a lot of bull crap in my opinion. No where on the ""I Forgot the PIN"" Roblox page, does it state that they are not able to. I even mentioned my ""irl"" age, but the best they could do is, ""Roblox does not reset pins upon user request"". But of course! I can totally ask my parents who are refugees and totally know how to use a video game website! Even after informing my plight, Roblox refuses. I've sent over 4-5 tickets over the course of 1-2 years, and nothings changed. I've been honest and honesty seems to be the terrible choice when it comes to Roblox.

I am sick of seeing all these games that are clearly a cash grab, and I have been blind to it until recently checking what my son has been begging for Robux for. Take for example Ninja Legends 2. These guys just put some shine on the original game and put a number 2 at the end of it. There is nothing new about the second game!! I just checked it myself on my sons tablet.

Why do the people who run Roblox let this stuff fly? Games like this only rename their original game and call it new so it forces children to re buy the same packs they already had, and the sad part is, many of these small children fall for it and beg their parents to buy them Robux to pay for something they already got..... its highway robbery. Something needs to be done about this soon. Roblox seems to be getting worse with all the Robux scams I need to constantly monitor that my kid is not falling for and now I have to make sure game creators are not ripping my kids off. I, and many parents in my community are going to start stepping up soon to try getting news out about this if something is not done soon. This stuff has to stop, and you need to stop letting people like this take advantage of children.

Edit: Forgot to add that I also play some games with my children on Roblox like Bee Swarm Simulator and a couple others, so this is how I know when I am seeing a scam, or something fishing going on.

It saddens me to realize that in the modern world we live in it is easily accessible for unsafe activity online. Roblox is the perfect place. 

Its younger player base as well as the fact that it is very is easy to grab kids attention. Whether it be by giving robux or offering in game items.  For example, in the ever so popular game collection of Pet Simulator, people just offer free pets through the trading option. They then add them and being talking. 

It is also very easy to fake your age, gender and name. For I have made and account which pretends me to be a 9 year old girl. I really hope roblox does something to stop these issues.

I have came up with a few ideas.  
\-Create an account limit to IP Address.  
\-Stop only thinking about monetary gain  
\-Remove the friends private chat feature all together  (If they wanted to chat they would do it else where)  
\-Add an age and gender verification system.   
\- Family settings and accounts ( Parent accounts look after and monitors friends and purchases...) Like the xbox feature.

I've read NewFissy make posts on here and clearly states the game is targeted for kids.

I play it occasionally with her, as it's actually not that bad of a game...but moreso to see how the kids go about it.

My daughter and kids love it and have a really good time playing together.

But it's pretty hectic, and I also kinda hate the develops for it at the same time. The second something new is released, my daughter, her friends and seemingly a majority of players in the game so ape shit for new stuff.

Like lately, a silly Ice Cream Truck comes in for 350 Robux. With au iTunes that's essentially $8.

Now, $8 isn't a whole lot for an in app purchase...but stuff like this rolls out regularly. Such young gamers are already getting addicted to in app purchases.

Yes, I am her parent and can simply prevent her from getting Roblox cards or iTunes cards, I know that. She will hate me for it...but I've taught her if you wait 2 weeks everyone seems to trade these 'old' items reasonably anyway.

Trading in Adopt Me is like supply and demand on crack, value of things change pretty quick.

Adopt Me also has another gaming demon, loot boxes. All of the pet eggs and even Robux purchased elements are all random. Such as buying golden fish and honey (I think that's what they are called, trying to 'win' legendary Bees & Penguins)

Our kids at such a young age are already being targeted for lottery based mechanics.
