My 7 y/o daughter whom I thought was an angel compared to her older sister, I found out she got banned for a day for saying ""bye btc"" to someone.  'Btc' apparently is an abbreviation for bitch, a way to get around the word filter.  I would assume she didnt even know what the letters btc meant and was only using it because someone else did....if only she didn't get caught a couple months earlier saying ""fuk u"" to someone on a YT comment section.  She was absolutely devastated when I caught her, she never uses these words IRL.  Anyway you have to be careful and monitor your kid all the time on Roblox, don't get mistaken for it all being innocent kid friendly.  I've seen my older daughter in a ""free paint"" type of game, and multiple kids were just using it to draw penises, boobs, and all types of curse words all over the walls.  

Can anyone else tell me which other games I need to look out for other than these free draw/paint griffiti type games.  I've seen some borderline innappropriate behavior in Brookenhaven.  What games should I pay closer attention to with my little one?",N/A,N/A

You sound like a helicopter parent. All ur going to do by trying to keep her away from bad stuff is increase her curiosity. Creating a rebel who won't listen to  a word you say. Take it from someone who became a rebel. 

There's worse things that calling people bitches. At this point in society people are almost desensitized to it. 

Be worried about the real problems. Like drugs and crime. 

Roblox is a safe place for the most part. Let kids be kids. But teach her about unsafe websites and talking to strangers online outside of game chats.",jayvdhx,N/A

Games like Isle or Natural Disaster Survival are good in the way that there are other people but they’re so busy playing that they don’t have time to think of slurs.,jaxzakc,N/A

Any city/high school roleplay game is infamous for having bad players. I'd also watch over what groups she joins, as those more isolated communities like military groups, school roleplays or other organizations can often be toxic. Royale High can also have some bad eggs, and it encourages microtransactions.

I recommend guiding her towards moreso minigame-like experiences. Work at a Pizza Place, for example.

Made account think I was 2 years old when making the account, and when the update that added 13+ features to the site I never changed the birthday, so my account was permanently stuck with me being practically an infant. And even after going to the support multiple times, I've still been given the same answer. 

Roblox is unable to change the age of an underaged account, even if you can legitimately prove you are above 13. As soon as you set it to below 13, regardless if it was a verified age prior to the switch, you cannot change the age till after the new age is 13+.",j3bcsok,N/A

comment,https://i.redd.it/snsbqmnhclr91.jpg,N/A,Ddustty,2022-10-03,1664836558.0,9,"I would like to counter some people here saying not to join RP games. If it’s just you and your daughter playing together some RP games are TOTALLY FINE. There are so many RP games on roblox and if your daughter enjoys things like playing house she will love those games! The first RP game I would recommend would be “Welcome to Bloxburg” (you can earn money and build a house for you and your daughter to live together as a family in! It’s one of my 9 year old sister’s favorite games to play with  her older sisters and friend from school! Another one would be “Horse Valley” (I believe that’s the name. There’s several horse ones) where you can get horses, train them to ride faster, jump higher, etc. You also take care of the horse and just simulate horse care in general! Another game franchise I could think she might like would be “Find The _____” (there are TONS of these games). It’s really simple where you just go around finding small .png critters or character models around a map. They usually have over 100 per game and are a nice time killer. I also enjoy playing “Work at a Pizza Place.” You can be a cashier, pizza maker, pizza boxer, delivery person or supplier. It’s also very simple to do most if not all of the jobs and is something you can do at whatever pace. The entire server works together to make and deliver pizzas for money to improve your house. You can buy furniture and decorate! “Cook Burgers” is a similar concept where you make burgers and the controls are wonky and fun to try and get used to! I believe this game has free private servers and doesn’t require the entire server to work together (but you are still in 1 big restaurant.) I recommend this next game with some added caution: “Adopt Me” is a fun popular game where you can hatch pets from eggs and earn money by taking care of your pet and also decorate your own house in this game as well. If you choose to play this game with your daughter I would HIGHLY recommend a private server. I do not know if they are free, but there are tons of players in the game whose only concern is scamming others out of pets. I would only play it with your daughter if she only plays roblox when she’s bonding with you, and you can separate yourselves from the massive player base. If you want more game ideas let me know! I have 4 younger sisters and am very well versed in roblox games. ***Some games I would avoid*** ANY games where drawing is involved and you can see others’ drawings. Too often to I find myself having to censor out sketches made by these young children who think drawing inappropriate NSFW is funny. It seems fun to draw with your child at first, but then they start to show up! (It’s not often, but often enough to be avoided) If your daughter players roblox without you I would avoid any games that have a “trade” feature. (Adopt me is included in this) Too many times have I witnessed my youngest sister crying because she got scammed and I spent hours trying to earn back the items for her. Do NOT join any games labeled as “clubs” or “hangouts” with a high amount of players. These are games to socialize and some actually have very inappropriate content inside. Be very careful with the tycoons you play because often times they are cash grabs where they just try to scam you out of robux using various well known characters/mascots and are littered with clickbait tags to boost their searches. One final game that I **recommend** that I myself got into recently and showed my sister was”Cooking in the Rain.” You spend your time gathering ingredients (that rain down from the sky) and cooking at your restaurant using various cookware. You slowly build up your restaurant to be bigger, better and have more recipes. When the restaurant is large enough you can unlock a “helper” item where others can help out at your restaurant! (If you worry about her understanding the mechanics you can work on the restaurant until you get helper unlocked and slowly teach her how the game works. My 9 year old sister is now kind of obsessed with the game. Lmk if you need any more help!",iqy05wp,N/A

comment,https://i.redd.it/snsbqmnhclr91.jpg,N/A,Rashmax2,2022-10-03,1664825009.0,4,"As a roblox developer I can definitely tell you do NOT play simulators (pet sim x, ...), RP games (adopt me, meepcity, ...) and the majority of tycoons, because all of them are designed to be cashgrabs on the younger audience (since you can turn robux into USD as a dev). Some tycoons like theme park tycoon 2 and retail tycoon 2 are fine, but I'd generally avoid the rest. Also just generally games to grind currencies (mainly sims aforementioned, but also things like Jailbreak) are a huge no go, because they require heavy grinding... or some cash. Epic minigames would be my recommendation, as I've played roblox since 9 a very long time ago and those types of games were (and are) fun without needing to spend money. I wish you a lot of fun playing games with your daughter and enjoying the bonding moments.

comment,https://i.redd.it/snsbqmnhclr91.jpg,N/A,HAPPYMANPOOPOOFISH5,2022-10-04,1664848313.0,1,Theme park tycoon2 is a good one. Bloxburg can be fun when you work on your house. Jailbreak is an okay game but the community can be very toxic at times but it’ll be a great game to play when they’re older. Car crushers can be fun. There’s some quality horror games on ROBLOX like DOORS and the rake remastered that I play all the time with my friends. They aren’t super scary and they are super fun. Doors Also doubles as sorta a puzzle game. Which is neat. Stay away from most RP games like adopt me MEEP city and Brookhaven. A lot of the times online dating occurs and in adopt me particular I would consider 90% of the game LITERALLY gambling for children. Most tycoons are fun to play and there are some fun co op ones. I’d suggest wizard tycoon 2 player right off the bat. It’s just an older classic game. There are many others. Simulators can be fun but many of them can be addicting. I don’t play simulators that often for that reason. But treasure hunt is honestly pretty fun. It’s been around for a while. And stayed true to its roots. It’s a good choice when it comes to simulators. Another thing you can also do is download to pro as a web extension and then use its random number generator to find a random game to play.

comment,https://i.redd.it/snsbqmnhclr91.jpg,N/A,rainbowpie14,2022-10-04,1664849217.0,1,"Main games I would say to avoid is the type of tycoon, simulator, and obby games that look ripped of from each other and current pop culture things because a lot of them have clear money scamming going on with their gamepasses, and probably for a lot of younger kids I would recommend staying away from anything with realistic guns like Arsenal. Contrary to what other people here have said I think (MOST) roleplaying games can be safe and fun for kids and I remember enjoying some when I was that age especially when I would play with my friends from school, but you have to either be playing with her, supervising her/checking in on her, or encouraging her to talk about what she does in them with you because there are the rare creeps there as with anywhere on the internet. There aren’t too many sketchy games that are mainstream since overall Roblox is a pretty safe platform for kids as long as you check in with them occasionally. There will always be people who aren’t safe and you have to be prepared for that- the fact that you’re taking the time to ask this doesn’t make me very worried about that though.

Some games that are good to play with family and friends in my experience are minigames like Epic Minigames and Ripull Minigames, silly food makers like Work at a Pizza Place and Make a Cake: Back for Seconds!, and (if you think your kid can handle it) non-detailed/unrealistic murder mystery games like Murder Mystery 2. Tower of Hell is also fun if you like obby games and a lot easier to play together with other people than regular obbies due to the nature of the game being a tower that regenerates every few minutes and the race to get to the top.

This list might be a little antiquated since I don’t play as much anymore but I remember liking this stuff plus a whole ton more I’ve either forgotten the names of, cut for length, or wouldn’t recommend these days as a kid.",iqyrslc,N/A

You get money from serving people food and there is a lot of strategy and plans to get a successful restraint going. Also bee swarm simulator, it’s a super simple, kinda quirky(in a good way) and overall really fun game to play. It revolves around building a hive with better bees, each with different characteristics and features. Both of these games are perfect for younger audiences and can be enjoyed by 2 people-especially bee swarm sim, because you can help out the other player in battles and spawn sprouts which you can both finish and get rewards! Hopefully this helps and I hope you find plenty more games to play with your kid! Enjoy!😄🤙",ir051vu,N/A

Adopt Me: Adorable pets and a decent style, plus a massive avatar editor you can use free of charge.

Royal High: Amazing playerbase, beautiful graphics, and a massive unique avatar editor.

Obbies: A classic Roblox genre, and a personal favourite of mine as a somewhat veteran player.

Meep City: It's a bit controversial this one, but it again has a huge avatar editor, little Meep pets you can adopt, and let's you passively earn points the longer you play together.

As for the games I'd avoid for now...

Doors: Despite the popularity, its a horror game with ample scary elements. Not for the faint of heart.

Evade: See above + Playerbase is a bit toxic at times

Any ""Condo"" Games: these tend to market themselves as hangout games, but are actually NSFW games that aren't actually allowed on the platform. Please report any games like this and make sure your child avoids them. :(

Tower Defense Simulator: The community is a little bit annoying, and the game itself is more if a Pay to Win.

Arsenal: Thought not genuinely graphic, it's a first person shooter, so not the ideal game for an 8 year old. I'd say if you enjoy FPS games however I'd highly recommend it !

Hope this is good enough info. Have fun both of you",ir05l3x,N/A

The game revolves around surviving the natural disaster. On a small map with around 20 other people, you try and outrun, hide and survive the natural disaster, there are heaps of cool maps which are randomly selected and it’s a pretty easy game and is rather self explanatory. The disasters are also pretty Roblox-y as they aren’t super realistic or scary, and are just a big blue curve for the tsunami or spreading red colour for a fire. There is a reason this game is still played after all these years, hopefully you get the time to check it out, I definitely recommend👍",ir064o8,ir05h0f

The concept is done well, and while there are often timewalls where you can't really do anything, they added time warps in 0.4 to pass them in less time. Time warps aren't broken either. At minimum, you can hold 3 30 minute time warps, and they generate every eight hours. Upgrades in the game can decrease that time. There is a daily reward system where you can get flowers every day, and flowers come from goals and can upgrade many things including the aforementioned time warps.

First, a quick background, then I'll ask my actual question. I don't play Roblox, but my daughter in-law does. A LOT. Probably too much...she doesn't get game time at her dad's because he's one of those ""internet is evil/downfall of society"" types, so we tend to be a little more lax at our place. But lately it's been too much, and her attitude has shifted and she's gotten.....idk, best word for it is ""weird"" about the game, the time she spends in it, and most importantly, how her mom and I view her time and habits in the game. Child in question is about to turn 16, and my overall concern is both time spent in-game and what she's DOING in game. I'll elaborate, hoping that some random internet stranger out there has run into something similar and can offer some insight and advice, because overall, random internet strangers tend to be happy to do just that more often than not.

Like I said, I don't play myself, but it seems like an innocent enough game, and I didn't see any issue with her spending time in it creating characters, running about and chatting with random folks about common interests etc etc. It's mostly about shared anime interests and other games they like to play. But within the past couple weeks, we've noticed her sneaking downstairs at all hours of the night to play, so we checked the tablet for game times/usage, and after about a week of that, we're talking about like almost 20 hours/day on Roblox. That's obviously a concern, and had we noticed the sneaking out of bed sooner we would have nipped that in the bud immediately, but she's very sneaky, and her being up before us is common (she's a 5am kid by nature) and frankly, we just didn't realize it was happening. So that's the time spent concern, which is pretty easily fixed with some reasonable game time limitations and a conversation. We had that conversation, and her reaction to it was so out of character that now we're really concerned as to WHAT she's been up to in there. It was a guilty, ""deer in the headlights"" reaction, like she got caught doing something she knew damn well was not ok...

Her mom got into the game's chat window one evening when she was being particularly dodgy about what she was up to in-game to see if she could see anything obviously amiss - racial stuff, sexual stuff, that sort of thing, and we pretty quickly realized we simply DO NOT know enough about the game, the dialogue and abbreviations or the overall in-game community to even really make sense of what we were reading. Near as I can tell tho, it seems there's some kind of in-game relationship, some sort of love triangle or something? Is that...a thing? Does that sort of thing go on in this game? I'm not judging, I was doing weird stuff on the internet at that age too, but this is having IRL effects on her moods, attitude, sleep patterns, etc. 

So, I guess my question is, what did we stumble onto, how worried should we be, and is there some sort of sexual lingo or component to the game that I had no idea existed? Or are we overthinking it and she just got stuck into a bit of an obsession to the game (we've all been there, I lost about a week of sleep when Skyrim first came out) Can it all be solved by pulling her into other interests for awhile to ween off the Roblox dopamine hits, or is there a darker, seedier component to the game that involves stuff that's a lot more concerning than simple hyper fixation? 

Any input is welcome, and yes, I realize parenting mistakes were made here as well, I'm not blaming any of this on the kiddo, just trying to understand what's happening and how to help resolve it. I don't have any kids of my own, and the whole idea of parenting is new to me...idk WTF I'm doing...but I've seen a definite shift in her daughter's overall behavior, and her mom's brain has gone to the darkest possible place about all of this, so I'm searching for anything I can do to help resolve it and ease her mind about the whole thing. And if you've made it this far, thanks for sticking it out, I know this a TL:DR type of post! :)",N/A,N/A

Roblox allows you to see the last few dozen games played. She may be addicted to a specific Roblox game or even multiple. It's possible she just really likes a game on Roblox. A lot of games on the platform are pretty addicting. If you're worried about that you could try to find something else for her to do. There are also some weird social hangout games (Like Public Bathroom games). Those types of games are packed full of people doing inappropriate stuff that Roblox needs to crack down on. But I don't know if that's the case here. If you can name some games she played I could tell.

Also, I highly doubt you'd find anything too raunchy in the Roblox chat because of how censored it'd be. There are ways to say certain banned words if you remove a letter from a word or shorten it. However, it should be obvious from the context what the word meant so there probably isn't anything you'd miss there. Plus, if there was anything suspicious said on Roblox it'd probably be in-game and you wouldn't be able to see the chats from that. If she made any good friends on Roblox she'd have probably added them on Discord or another messaging app/social media to avoid issues with Roblox's chat filter. If you were worried about her interactions online you'd have to check her chats on those apps. Only do that though if you really suspect she's talking to the wrong people though. Prying through someone's private chats without consent is a huge invasion of privacy.",jap6ymv,N/A

BTW if you see a lot of ""#####"" messages in the chatbox then it could be ppl trying to bypass, so then something shady is going on.

Most of the competitive games hav a community that is so toxic, it makes the chernobyl disaster look like a minor oopsy. Roblox moderation is also not good. U should remember the abbreviations and search them up on the internet. U can also check her game history through recently played. Avoid any simulator games because 90% are just clicking with massive goals to reach, which takes up 90 to 100% of the playtime.

Talk to her about it, maybe that can work too. 3. Seek guidence from more professionals. I had a similar experience were overnight I would do nonstop attempting to play an online game, my reasoning for it was not because something new was happening no it was wayyy worse I had a thing for someone else there and I eventually grew out of it but it was exactly what you said your child started doing, overnight from playing regularly to excessive play sessions with no beak but food water shower and sleep.

Like the title says...sometimes my sons friends are playing and when they switch games he keeps auto joining their games. 

That’s nice for when they want to play together but sometimes he just wants to play his own game. He has two friends and they each sometimes keep switching games when they are each playing separately and he keeps getting bounced between both of them and he gets super frustrated.

Hello there. I’m a moderate gamer myself but don’t play Roblox. My 7 year old son wants to get it. I’m good with understanding how parental settings work with limiting chat and friend requests and what not. 

My question though is about what I guess is called ‘Condo rooms’. I’ve heard about there being some pretty graphic adult content in the game. 

I just need to know how you end up there. I’m assuming you can’t just go into a random server and it be that. I’m assuming it’s by invite only. Can anyone help me out in understanding this?",N/A,N/A

To get to a ""condo room"" you have to join a game that has them.

I can assure you no front page games have the condo rooms you're talking about where they roleplay god knows what, so your child would have to deliberately look that game up or click on a sponsor.

Once they find the game though, they can play it all they want.

With that being said, there may be some parental restrictions on the app as to what games they can play, perhaps it only enables Corporate-approved games, but I am not aware of a feature like this so far as I do not have a need for one, I develop the games not play them.

I can assure you Sir/Ma'am that Roblox is doing everything it can to get rid of such graphic games,by taking them down as quickly as possible.

For the chat and friends issue, the developers have done everything they can to ensure no foul language enters the chat,but while some users have managed to bypass the censor filter, i assure you that foul language or users will not be a large problem.

One thing I'd suggest is to moderate your child's use of the game,as I have to admit it is quite addictive.

(Here’s the basics) find an arrow and click/use and you get a random stand (sometimes people are toxic so beware in case some random dude bypasses)

The only time they would MAYBE find that would be in a hacked/exploited server but that is extremely unlikely nowadays. The parental controls really dont do much but reduce the point of the game which is is socialise but if you really that concerned about your son just check up and ask what he is playing occasionally.

""Boys and Girls"" is also a risk. The key word ""Adopt"" is bad too, with the exception of the game ""Adopt Me"", which is arguably the largest game out there and is ran by a group of very competent developers so I wouldn't worry too much about it.

For sponsors, those are very hard to catch. How a sponsor works is a developer sells a part of their ingame currency to the platform, and in return their game is plastered on the front page a certain amount of times for the next 24 hours. The issue with this in your case is that literally anyone, with the funds, can put any game they want up there. No games that repeatedly encourage this are usually sponsored, but a general rule of thumb for these sponsors is that if it has any of those key words, it's best to avoid the sponsor.

You can't block certain sponsors, due to as said earlier the sponsors change every minute, and are randomly picked from a pool of paid sponsors that are still active, which is usually in the hundreds of thousands.

As a whole, a 7 year old will have quite some difficulty coming across these games. Even if they do,  they have to click on it. And even if they click on it, they have to make their way to these condos. And even if they get to these condo rooms, Roblox has a very strong filter to the point that most people use implied slang when roleplaying, which a child might not understand as it is also horribly misspelled and often censored with ##### in attempts to bypass the filter. So just make sure that your child isn't in any of these games as you walk by.

I would also encourage you to get an account for yourself and pick some safe games off of the front page to play with your child, to distract them from going down a rabbit hole that could possibly lead to these hard to find club/condo games.

My final note is that Roblox does not have a search history. It does have a recently played though, so if your child recently played it you can find it on their home page.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** these games are pretty hard to come by, and a 7 year old will probably have no idea whats going on anyways. Be sure to avoid the stated keywords though, and help distract your child from boredom succumbing them by playing safe front page games with them.",goaiv81,goahqti

Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/hq5rql/13_accounts_parental_controls_question_need_help/,<13 accounts - parental controls question (need help with my foster son’s account),Scarya,2020-07-13,1594601798.0,7,"<13 accounts - parental controls question (need help with my foster son’s account)
Security + boring parent question. (I really need some help; please hear me out.)

My foster (soon to be adopted) son plays Roblox with his biological brother, who is in another foster home. I have absolutely no control over that other home, and I know that they have very little grasp of technology in general. My son’s account is set appropriately to his age, which is 12. He has only a few friends allowed in his account, and I routinely monitor his activity. (Because of a significant history of trauma, abuse, and neglect, his functional age is much lower than his chronological age, and poor judgment is a major concern.)

His brother has very little supervision with games (despite the same trauma history), and I have no idea if his account is set up as a <13 account. (He is 11.) I heard him say on the phone today that he has “100 friends.”

(I’ll give you all time to stop laughing before I continue. Lol) I work in healthcare IT but I am NOT a gamer. I’m 50. I’m OLD.

Can “over 13” accounts interact with “under 13” accounts? Is 100 friends excessive for a kid who’s 11? 

Any other tips, thoughts, etc., are welcome.

Thanks!",N/A,N/A

accounts that are under 13 are forced to be secure. they have a stricter filter ingame and in most cases are only allowed to communicate with friends.

on an unrelated note, there is a part of the playerbase (not sure how large but i would say possibly 10%) that have cheats and some of them are able to use them to do inappropriate things. i wouldn't say it's very common to see it happen, i've seen maybe it 2 or 3 times and i've been playing for over 8 years. the security against them has kind of cracked down on them but there's still a few of them going around sometimes. the popular games that are found on the front page are generally free of them.

tl;dr as long as he's being monitored he's safe",fxw94kq,N/A

Also remind him to not put personal info on the chat as well.

Once the account becomes 13+, it can access 'Social Links' to websites like Discord. Keep in mind that everyone there will be 13+ unless some <13's lie about their age. These Discord chats will be about the ROBLOX game or the group that they are connected to so you shouldn't have to worry too much.

100 friends is **not too excessive** because most 9-11 year-olds have maximised their list to 200 friends at that time. What most friends do is just follow each other into game and realise: 'Oh wait, I friended this person, ok whatever.' But what some people do is if they find that a person is good at being a duo or some people is good at being group, then they might friend the other people, so they can play together some other time. 

There are such things as private conversations which both <13 and 13+ accounts can access. The ROBLOX software automatically creates a new one with every new friend. This is used to chat without having unwanted players in it. There can also be a chat group which has a maximum of 6 players (They all have to be friended to the person who started it). You can change the name of the group as well, but it is filtered, as well as the chat itself (Filtered messages will not be sent).   

TL;DR: 

\+13 and <13 can communicate, 

100 friends is not too excessive, 

13+ can access 'Social Links' to places like Discord

Private conversations available to 13+ and <13 - can only chat with people who are friended.",fxwoc0n,N/A

What you can do is, press buy robux, select the Robux package (closest to the robux you can redeem) on the payment type select Redeem Roblox Card. This will be deducted to your Roblox Credit of $25 when you submit order. That's it. The rest of your credit balance can be directly converted to Robux.",j6wjdhm,N/A
comment,https://i.redd.it/k19dluyprpfa1.jpg,N/A,richcvbmm,2023-02-02,1675357783.0,1,"So from what I gathered, Roblox is changing the “convert to robux” option because on the buy robux page, it changes the price of robux based on the location your trying to buy it from. for example Canada or the US. this is because $1 US is $1.32 CAN. But the “Convert to Robux” option did not. So if you bought and redeemed a $25 gift card bought in Canada, you would then have $25 of credit. But the “convert to Robux” option treated it as $25 US not $25 CAN. So the problom starts once you convert the credit to robux. This is because when you convert it, it would give you robux equivalent to $25 US. Which is $33.29 CAN. So you would get extra Robux equivalent to $8.29 CAN or $6.22 US. Now imagine you did this with a currency of even lesser value then the US dollar.",j6xpo0b,N/A

Ok, so the title says it all. I am sick of seeing all these games that are clearly a cash grab, and I have been blind to it until recently checking what my son has been begging for Robux for. Take for example Ninja Legends 2. These guys just put some shine on the original game and put a number 2 at the end of it. There is nothing new about the second game!! I just checked it myself on my sons tablet.

Why do the people who run Roblox let this stuff fly? Games like this only rename their original game and call it new so it forces children to re buy the same packs they already had, and the sad part is, many of these small children fall for it and beg their parents to buy them Robux to pay for something they already got..... its highway robbery. Something needs to be done about this soon. Roblox seems to be getting worse with all the Robux scams I need to constantly monitor that my kid is not falling for and now I have to make sure game creators are not ripping my kids off. I, and many parents in my community are going to start stepping up soon to try getting news out about this if something is not done soon. This stuff has to stop, and you need to stop letting people like this take advantage of children.

Edit: Forgot to add that I also play some games with my children on Roblox like Bee Swarm Simulator and a couple others, so this is how I know when I am seeing a scam, or something fishing going on.

UPDATE: Ok so I got what I needed from this thread, I will still stop in and reply once in a while, and I will just leave it here for people to discuss among themselves their experiences with games on the platform. People tell me I am wrong, but there is a reason this thread has so many up votes and support in the comments. Only people telling me im wrong are kids who like the game, or the studios goons they send to down vote and trash talk the thread. Parents are starting to remove their kids from the Roblox platform, and justly so. They are no longer a safe platform for children as they once were. When children are targets of greedy adults and corporations, it's time to do something about it!!",N/A,N/A

Bubblegum Simulator is a prime target for this. 2x hatch speed, 2x luck, multi egg hatches, auto resource collect (totalling at around 2-3k robux). honestly such a disappointing turn for roblox games IMO. take this with a grain of salt since i've never played ninja legends 1 or 2, and probably dont plan on it.",giadfz4,N/A

All these ""simulator"" games are mostly the same thing. It is a business practice. Child play game, game get too hard, then they buy stuff for robux to make it easier. Like the other commenters said, there isn't much the staff at ROBLOX can do about it. It is, essentially, making ROBLOX money too, since there is a cut of the robux purchases made in games going to roblox staff, so maybe that is why they won't moderate these simulator cash grabs.

What can YOU do about it?

Not much. Teach your child that maybe these games aren't worth their time. Maybe help them survey the site and see any other interesting games your child might play. At the end of the day, it all comes down to you.

As for the sequel thingy:

As far as I have seen, this is a mildly rare occurance of repackaged games made sequels. So this is one of those rare occurrences, don't worry about that too much.",giafecg,N/A

Roblox does not care that much for the quality of the gaming hemisphere or the site itself too much. As long as they are pulling in millions of dollars, “who cares if games are preying on little kids, it’s making us rich.”

I can’t even put the blame all on Roblox because they don’t make the games. I’ve been a player since 2011. The community had its faults then as it does now but it just wasn’t this bad or heartless. Biggest reason is because of the developer exchange. As great as it is. Now it’s kinda trash because the rates aren’t good but yeah it makes people want to generate as much robux as they can on their game just to cash out. Honestly sadly this type of bull crap only works on children. And Roblox didn’t originally market towards children until obviously the saw the profit potential.

There are still many games that are made for fun and aren’t pay 2 win. But it gets harder and harder to find if you aren’t an og of roblox or deep in the dev community.

I have nothing against making robux with your products. But I’m with you, some developers are just ripping people off and it’s so lame.",gib5siw,N/A

And stuff does get changed code wise and visual wise. It's just how sequels usually are executed. 

The same happens with FIFA, a less obvious but similar thing happens with assassin's creed and even GTA. Mechanics get changed but the core mechanics remain the same conceptual wise. It's what it is and there's little to change about it.

As for background info as to how I kno this, I myself am a roblox developer (programmer specifically) and work as a freelancer for several years now and am currently majoring in Game Development as an education, you can check me out under the name VoidedBlades. 

I'd just like to point out that these ""cash grabs"" are nothing more but a kid liking something and wanting to spend money on it, could even compare it to a person's hobby where they'd spend thousands of dollars on it. or even continuously buying lego for a kid as they love to play with it. However hobbies will usually change with time.

I just find it simply rude to claim that they just take the same game and rename it. A lot of work goes into reworking a game for a sequel even though a consumer might not directly see it.

Last but not least, we also need to make money to live. Roblox is our source of income despite it being an instable soure as income fluctuates heavily for a lot of developers.

And before assumptions are made. I do not create these type of games (I have contact with those who do and have had an in depth look on the genre and execution) as they don't lie within my range of interest.",giad5pr,N/A

These ""Simulator""-type games are specifically engineered to draw kids in and take their money, their greed tarnishing the very reputation of Roblox game development in general. 

The game dev community is kinda split into two types of developers: Those who actually MAKE good games and those who make cash grabs to take people's money. I call them ""Makers"" and ""Takers"" respectively.

The best advice I can give is to teach your child that there's no shame in playing the original game, as sequels tend to be bad anyways; and try to find some other games with actual gameplay value, so ""simulator""-type games become boring to him.",gib6rmz,N/A

moving onto the statements about it using all of the same gamepasses/purchases:  
the only things I can see that are similar in terms of monetization between the two (granted I've only looked at their store tab on the website) are the things like perks. 2x storage, 2x collection, that kind of thing. I don't really see anything wrong here, almost all games have them, they're entirely optional and are only there to help speed up progression.  


in summary:  
at the end of the day, its entirely up to the developer(s) of that game to choose if they want to create a sequel based off the work that they've put into it. maybe there's just more they wanted to add to the second game that they couldn't do with the first due to technical limitations, maybe they just simply needed more money as you said. the developers of this game are people too and they need to make a living in order to pay for rent, food, etc. just like everyone else. in my opinion, saying otherwise is well, putting it politely, rather disrespectful of you.",giaj1va,N/A

If you really want to let your kid have Robux without ripping a hole in your wallet, install Google Opinion Rewards. It's a first party app by Google that's actually trustable. You answer questions related to you and other stuff, and it gives you Google play credit that expires within a year. You can spend this on anything in the Google play shop, I ncluding Robux.

I ABSOLUTELY agree with you on how games are just remade in a different context that makes it seem different, but in reality is basically the same. The thing is, ROBLOX is a place where they ""Power Imagination,"" in a nutshell. Basically every game is made by users, (As I'm sure you know,) and the userbase/developers would complain if their game was taken down for ""scams,"" as technically it's not a scam, but in essence, it basically is. My solution is to not play those games, I know the issue is that your child probably only plays those games ... and I don't know what to do about it. As for robux spending ... I've only spent it on catalog items, clothing or in the select games in play that I adore. MOST simulator games are filled with those annoying/not very useful gamepasses.  

Now for actual scams: People have tried to scam me tons of times for robux, mainly by PMs on ROBLOX. They claim to be a ""User reporter,"" or something. I've watched tons of videos on those, and no you scammers cannot have my limiteds.

But I would like to stress that not all studios are like this, There are good developers on the platform that bring interesting and unique things to ROBLOX, it is a shame that there are some bad apples that give the platform a bad rep That plus the limits of the ROBLOX engine its self, And the fact that ROBLOX gives us pretty crappy exchange rates. Which can be the reason ROBLOX games have so many microtransactions (Though I don't defend these actions And Defiantly am against pay 2 win.) Best way to find good ROBLOX games for you and your child is to avoid the front page games, They are often the more clickily microtransaction games of the platform. Instead I'd recommend searching online for some ROBLOX games that fit you and your Childs favoured genre, There are a lot of YouTube videos on good ROBLOX games.

As a Roblox player since 2008, I have seen the change of Roblox turning more into a cash grab platform. If you did not know, back in the early days of Roblox there used to be a 2nd Roblox currency known as Tix. Every player got 10 Tix every day as a daily log-in reward and could get more Tix by place visits in which you got 1 Tix for every visitor. The user could of spent Tix to buy items in the catalog and could trade Tix for Robux using the **RoblEX** trade system. Sadly in 2016 Roblox removed Tix making everything now require Robux, this the where the modern-day problem that you have stated comes into effect. Sadly the people who run Roblox seem to not care anymore since now they make more money from people buying Robux. The only way to see if Roblox really wants to change this is if a Tix like system returns, which will sadly most likely never happen again.",gib2csc,N/A

I'd recommend the kids to play games that are original and not that too popular since jn my experience the buy with robux pop up rarely appear to me. Avoid if not be cautious on tycoon or any other simulator shenanigans they have a cesspool of scam items that doesnt do much and might be not permanent. Teach the kids to be wary on clicking things fast without hesitation this might slwp their progression on the game they'd chosen but its the safest way.
Clothes:
Shirts and pants are repetitive and sometimes too cheap or too expensive which can scam in anyway matter. Cheaps can be deleted just like mine, they tend to sell it at 5 robux and adds an eyecatching name and design. Same with the expensive ones. In my opinion they should buy at a group ad and game clothes market or buy originals at the origin.
Accessories are okay
Gear never buy them at all
Limited they are just collectors item which they resell or something idk why.

Lastly make sure the children never go to free robux sites without their acc having a pin and a verified email. They might not take your password but they can take your IP and might use it to their advantage. Some may actually give them robux but still its better to be safe than sorry.

If a game is making everyone rebuy their packs, so be it. The smarter part of their playerbase will simply move on and stop playing. The roblox economy will decide the fate of the game.

That's it. It's people's freedom to make what games they want, play what games they want, and spend robux on what games they want. Even if a game was the scummiest thing ever that constantly reset progress and forced you to buy everything again, as long as it's not breaking any rules (such as nudity) then it's fine to be there.

The value of robux compare to the US dollar is continuing inflating every time someone buys robux. The only reason why it hasn't inflated to the point of it being post WWI Germany is this thing called tax, where roblox (the corporation) receives 30% of all robux transaction and whenever someone buys a item created by roblox with robux. The only way of obtaining robux legally is buying roblox premium because it offers more then buying regular robux, but the pricing is expensive enough where someone can't just buy over 100,000 robux without spending $1,000 usd (only reason why someone would do this is if they are investing in limited items but that's another topic) but too expensive where you not really getting your money worth if you don't buy premium.

Anyways, all games die at some point, and some game devs milk the same cow. Trying to make as much robux without much more work. And with 30% tax on purchases that affects games dev robux income, they add new stuff, maybe change visual, mostly small changes, called it ""insert game name 2"" create the game, and milk the same cow to make robux. and because its a new game, the gamepass are incompatible. So if a dev makes a net total of 140k robux off the game, that's because 30% of the gross income gets taxes, which in this example 60k robux. (They can also exchange robux to USD on a special rate and on a special program called DevEX, but thats another topic. Obviously they can only exchange their net robux income made from the game)

I have no clue if the game devs are greedy but its a economic reason of why these things happen. Its it a good reason? Most likely not. Buts its a reason as regards to economics of roblox.

If a game dev really want to make robux and have a stable income is to just update their one game instead of creating a copy of it, slap a number on it, and call it a day.",gic1eyl,N/A

Granted, I did have Roblox Premium Benefits, but I didn't spend any money on the game. I got some pets for free from some generous people and also got some pets from small Youtubers livestreaming and giving away pets. It's not that hard to play without robux. Also, the second Ninja Legends is cleaner and more challenging + interactive for users. I personally like the game a lot, and a lot of effort was put into the game, because it would take most people years to even create the map, but there is a lot of detail put into this game. It is a little bit pay to win, but every game has that aspect, no matter the size of the P2W.

Pretty all of the sports games that are out are sequels with no changes other than graphics, roster, and a new number. Not all AAA companies have bad, P2W releases, though. But, if you take a look at smaller companies making indie games, they put a lot of effort into their style, and unique gameplay.

On Roblox, simulators don’t need to put any effort into their updates, and they’ll be popular. I don’t know how much effort it takes in order to produce their types of updates, so I can’t really judge them. But, they can release the same thing they did last update but with some remodels, and a different theme.

If you play a smaller game, or a game that’s made by a good group, updates/releases might take longer to come out but they have more quality to them, and they don’t feel as lazy as the larger games.

My personal recommendation for games on Roblox include:

[Arsenal](https://www.roblox.com/games/286090429/Arsenal) \- Fast-paced FPS with its main game mode being ‘gun game’ where you get a new gun every kill.

[Loomian Legacy](https://www.roblox.com/games/306964494/Holiday-Event-Loomian-Legacy?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Pokémon like gameplay.

[Welcome to Bloxburg](https://www.roblox.com/games/185655149/Welcome-to-Bloxburg?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) (paid access) - Build a house and roleplay with others.

[Vehicle Simulator ](https://www.roblox.com/games/171391948/2021-Vehicle-Simulator?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Unlike other simulators, you actually use a vehicle to drive around, and simulate something.

[Robeats!](https://www.roblox.com/games/698448212/feat-fusq-RoBeats-MMO-Rhythm-Game?refPageId=241b68e9-ce71-4979-889e-11c2042d7ab2) \- Vertical Scrolling Rhythm game, best rhythm game on Roblox in my opinion.

[Bad Business](https://www.roblox.com/games/3233893879/Bad-Business-2-12?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Good FPS with really good, and fast movement.

[Outlaster](https://www.roblox.com/games/5343994291/Outlaster?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) or [Eviction Notice](https://www.roblox.com/games/2577040780/Eviction-Notice-BETA) \- Identical styles of gameplay where you play mini games, and vote out people in your team at the end of rounds.

[Iron Man Simulator 2 ](https://www.roblox.com/games/6097258548/Iron-Man-Simulator-2-BETA?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Simple controls and gameplay where you can use Iron Man suits.

[Horrific Housing](https://www.roblox.com/games/263761432/2021-Gift-Horrific-Housing?refPageId=629b6114-ee99-47a2-ac0c-3e6007e26a00) \- Stand on plates (with various game modes) and try to survive the events.

[Black Magic II](https://www.roblox.com/games/969669348/Black-Magic-II-RANKED?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- The most unique fighting game on Roblox, game play is kind of like Street Fighter, or Dragon Ball FighterZ.

[Anime Battle Arena](https://www.roblox.com/games/1458767429/HOLIDAY-Anime-Battle-Arena) \- Fight using anime characters, the gameplay is more simple compared to Black Magic II.

[SARB](https://www.roblox.com/games/5848360485/SARB) \- Super Smash Bros. like gameplay but it's in 3D.

[Doomspire Brickbattle](https://www.roblox.com/games/1215581239/Doomspire-Brickbattle?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- A game from the older Roblox, but remastered to fit Roblox's new physics, and engine (I don't know if that's the right word for it).

[Tower Defense Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/3260590327/Tower-Defense-Simulator?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- Tower defense gameplay like Kingdom Rush, and Bloons, where you try to protect a location by placing units.

[World of Magic](https://www.roblox.com/games/3272915504/World-of-Magic?refPageId=265842f0-759b-4f98-85a6-2190dc8c3c11) \- Open world game, with a magic combat system, and your actions affect the world.",gici0x7,N/A

Roblox has made the in-game chat system nearly unbearable to communicate almost everything is censored with hashtags. I honestly don’t know what more can you ask Roblox to do in order to ensure kids aren’t getting duped.

Here’s the silver-lining, kids who got scammed got a taste of the real world; scams don’t just happen on Roblox or online. They will learn how to be skeptical and understand when something is too good to be true.

Honestly parents with this overprotective mindset is just hurting them in the long run. Kids need to learn how the Internet works, their own action have consequences and experience the world by themselves, if they fuck up they will learn through their mistakes.

Once you get scammed once it’s pretty hard to get scammed again unless you didn’t learn your lesson.

I’m not a parent and I’m pretty dam sure if I had kids I would have a different mindset; but hopefully my statement still stands if I ever have kids.",gijcoxv,N/A

Unfortunately for your wallet, repackaged, rebranded, renumbered simulator games are what become popular. Take a game that has actual effort into it and compare it to any ""lifting simulator."" Kids want to play games on Roblox that they can get good at quickly, with a robux shortcut here and there. This implementation of microtransactions based on ""u spend money you get better"" is essentially what happens in every major game ever so long as it isn't based solely on PVP. Take GTA V for an example, you can buy shark cards and content packs like the CESP, and people have been complaining about this for years but nothing is done because the majority BUY THEM, the same as the majority of Roblox plyers enjoy these so-called ""cash grabs"". So, as their parent, you can tell your children they cant have robux, or you can let them have a little for them to spend wherever they want. Other than that, its unnecessary to complain about what and how these developers make their money. If you dont let your kid buy robux, you dont support the games.",gik7qz4,N/A

I gave it a good read, but it don't answer my question or concern at all. My big beef is with a game my child has been playing recently called Ninja Legends 2. I asked him today, why has he wanted Robux so badly. He replied with a smile that, a new game has been released on Roblox and he wanted game passes for it. I then asked him if I could see the game he was talking about, as sometimes I find them interesting and want to try them myself. After all, my kid is the reason I am one of the top players on Bee Swarm Sim. Anyhow. He brings his tablet over and shows me Ninja Legends 2. I had played the first one with my kids for a while, but ended up getting bored of it after a while. When he loaded the world. I was like, wait.... This looks exactly like the first game. Then I tarted checking the game passes that my son wanted. Not only are there the same ones from the first Ninja Legends, but they added new ones to scrape a little more money from our pockets.... This is a Ponzi Scheme, and in the real world, they are illegal. It almost seems like game creators for Roblox platform think they are safe from this because a bunch of children play it and don't know any better.

Children will believe things are new if someone tells them it is. These are very scummy tactics and the fact that its allowed anger me. Steam has also cracked down on copy paste games, this I am thankful for, and is long overdue. So if other game gaming platforms can deal with it, I don't see why Roblox is struggling with taking care of it.

Don't get me wrong, if you are making games that are interesting and fun, then great, I would probably check those games out with my kids, because I play the games with them and I also buy game passes when I like the game, but they cant pull the wool over my eyes as easily as they do with kids.

My concern is not with dumb pointless games. It's with creators copy pasting their original game and calling it new. This is clearly a cash scam/scheme and nothing is ever done about it. Some people seem to think the owners have no power over these things, but they do, problem is, when the creators make money, they make money, so they let it float until it gets out of hand, or until to much attention is drawn to it before they remove it, or do anything about it.",gia6ka4,gia5srq

That's true but this is a minority of the games. There's no way in restricting these games to monetize themselves as that's just as wrong. 

Not to mention that this doesn't fall under scamming. Scamming would be an illegal act of swindling someone out of their money for nothing (of equal value in return) or not getting what's stated when bought, which in this case they are getting. If not it's a violation of roblox's ToU. The value here is determined by the creator and stated when bought so the upper hand lies with them.

I have yet to make an informative post about scamming matters in terms of how they work as I've previously have given an in depth informative post on the devforums about cookie logging and several commonly executed scam attempts attached to it and how to prevent it from happening to yourself.

Don't get me wrong. A reupload of a previously created game (if they own the intellectual property) is morally wrong but legally not, if it would be companies like EA would be in major trouble with their 3rd reupload of the exact same game.

The only way I'd see possible is to simply restrict kids to spend their robux on those games.",giafuju,giael0d

As I said previously, this is not ""in all aspects the same"" their new game has new (and not to mention higher quality) models, effects, artwork, animations, etc. just because the layout of the map is the same, it doesn't mean anything is wrong with it, it means that was the one aspect of the game they decided to bring over in order to make things intuitive to returning players. its not a criminal offense.
2. I am not ""defending"" any kind of behavior, I am simply stating the fact (and this is universal across all the games industry, not to mention business) that there is a certain point in a considerable overhaul where it just makes sense to create a sequel.
3. What's wrong with paid promotion? that has been happening since the dawn of YouTube and Twitch (if not earlier if you count TV ads), these developers are not the first to do this. Pretty much every games company imaginable has done this at some point. there is nothing wrong with it. there is a mutual benefit between the consumer, the content creator (weather its a youtuber or streamer, etc.) and the developer.
4. So what if they're trying to make money? Roblox as a platform is very unpredictable in terms of earnings. I cannot blame them in the slightest for perhaps monetizing *their* product in a way that will help them live in case of a sudden drop in revenue and players. you can't really blame them for not wanting to end up living on the street.",giakheg,giajm13

TIX was removed because when it was a thing, new players automatically got a certain amount of TIX (I don't know how much since it's been so many years but I'm guessing 20). You can also exchange a certain amount of TIX for exactly 1 Robux (again it's been years, so I don't know how much but I think you needed 100 TIX). So, the smart kids and adults used this to their advantage and spammed accounts and bought things that their main account made, which would usually be a shitty T-Shirt that costed TIX. The main account would get tons of TIX to exchange for Robux and the alt accounts would be left in the darkness. So, ROBLOX didn't remove it just because it wasn't making them money; they were actually losing money and the economy was being ruined.

Which is why you should probably teach your son to avoid this kind of stuff? Teach him how to avoid peer pressure and think critically? You've talked about the real world in some of your other comments. Why not kill two birds with one stone and teach him how to deal with scams, peer pressure and the like using Roblox? It's a valuable life skill. That's all I'm saying.

I was once a child. I know what it's like with this kind of stuff, and I'm glad my parents taught me how to deal with stuff like this. (Not saying you are a bad parent.)

I'm not defending these practices, I just think this rant of yours is sort of useless because nothings going to change for two reasons: A), Roblox won't care, and B) The games aren't explicity breaking any rules. They shouldn't be taken down for ""scamming"" because they technically aren't and that would lead to bad precedent for the rest of roblox's games. Kind of like a vague rule which could technically be used to take down any game roblox admins dont' want around. That example is a exaggeration but I hope you get what I mean.

Again, no one is being forced to do stuff here. Manipulation != forced, and that's why I think these games shouldn't be taken down. As addicting a game is, as manipulative a youtuber is, at the end of the line, you're choosing to spend that money, that robux, and your time. You have to learn how to control it and think through it. Hard stuff to teach to a kid, I know, but now's a good time as any to start. (Besides... can't you just outright deny him the robux? Explain why you won't give it to him? Not trying to tell you how to parent your own children, just curious.)",gie0zpk,gicppaq

Micro-transactions have become very heavy in most games. It's disappointing but expected if the dev team is looking for revenue.

The game I'm working on with my best friend consists of a currency that is earnable in-game as well. I myself despise locking players behind pay walls, or even allowing players who pay to get a large advantage.

So all the content, specifically cosmetics, are earnable. Most are locked either way, behind methods of finding them/earning them, but the ones you can purchase are bought through what we call Hypercoin.

The Hypercoin is earnable, found through lucky spawns, completing contracts, drops from bosses or even enemies, and daily rewards.

Sadly that snowballing has already been happening for years within that genre as it's to keep generating profit, there's no benefit in doing this on roblox's end as they'll lose valuable profit (their value has already been falling) nor is there anything legally that I can think of that'll make this happen.

This is something that seems uncontrollable from a consumer's perspective other than disallowing their children to spend Robux on the games that do that. 

Regardless, striving for such a change isn't bad whatsoever. It just seems out of reach in my eyes, which leaves the responsibility at the parents/guardians.

We're talking about a platform on the internet that has a main focus on having content generated for money after all. The internet is a scary place and can cause a lot of damage in a small time if treated without caution. That caution is usually one's own responsibility or of their parents/guardians.

One thing I do know is that this has only happened so far in the Roblox simulator genre (correct me if you've seen games in other genres do this) which is a current trend but should soon or later die out, just like any other trend on roblox, due to how it has been milked.",gib6z86,giah22p

Just Looked through SEC S-1 Filings for Roblox and saw nothing about age range for game developers. I however did find that they will not file with anyone under the age of 18, so someone of adult age is running and filing for them in any case. Which means an adult is influencing the games path and profit.

I read your edit up in the post (not the comments) and you're immediately branding anyone who goes against your opinion a Roblox shill or a 7 year old kid. That really doesn't encourage thoughtful discussion and kind of shows me that there's no point trying to talk to you, as you're opinion's already been made. 

I'm not sure if you know this, but Roblox does not make the games. All of Roblox's content is completely player made. (Well, with the exception of some events and tutorial games. Heck, the whole point of Roblox originally was kids making games and playing other kid's games.) What does this mean?

Any multiplayer game has the danger of Adults and susceptible children meeting. It's not a new thing. Usually, the multiplayer game has safeguards, such as safe chat, child friendly mode, or whatever. But in the end, it's ultimately up to YOU to teach your kid how to behave safely and responsibly online. The game can only do so much.

It's almost the same in Roblox's case. These are multiplayer interactions between players to players. People playing other player's games. Not player to company. You see, that's the huge difference. They can't be held accountable in the same ways. 

I hope you understand that I'm putting emphasis on you and your son for a reason, not because I only read a few sentences of your comments. The solution is with YOU guys, not the other way around. 

Look, I understand that these practices are quite shitty. But there's a real difference between actual scams and these ""scams"". I've seen games get taken down for real scams. For instance, you buy a gamepass that promises a sword but all you get is a crappy t-shirt. That's a real, bonifide scam. Meanwhile, with your case, you're getting what you pay for. Sure, the game could only last one more day after you buy a gamepass and now you feel cheated. But the gamepass never promised how long the game would last, did it? Scummy, but legal. These practices are NOT criminal, despite how close they may seem. Taking action against things like these leave a HUGE precedent and could be damaging for all of Roblox. 

Let's talk about the targeting aspect and the kids being taken advantage of. Where does the solution lie? That's right, with YOU. Your son is choosing to play these games, and therefore he must learn how to deal with the issues on this platform. He is choosing to play these scammy games, despite there being tons of other games out there. Issues that are out of his control, like nudity, swearing, etc, that is the type of stuff Roblox is trying to prevent. 

""Children should NEVER EVER be taken advantage of by adults."" I agree, but its the goddamn INTERNET. It never ever will be safe. Like, c'mon. If your child can't handle Roblox, maybe it's not the company's fault. It's not Roblox's job on how to teach your kid 21st century skills. They do what they can, but when it comes to issues born out of free-will, what the hell are they supposed to do? Your kid WANTS to buy this stuff, and if it's due to manipulation and targeting, then you need to teach him how to defend to against this shit. As long as free speech exists, manipulation will too. Connecting your child to the internet comes with huge responsibilities. You know that.

If you don't want to deal with this kind of stuff, then of course you can withdraw your kids from playing Roblox. If you believe that's the safest choice for you and your kids, then good for you. You're making the choices here.

I've said my piece. Have a wonderful day.",gifr7cg,gied12v

The games aren’t hidden at all, you just need to look in the right places. Games will slip your notice even if they’re quality ones. Front page has lots of bad, lots of good.

And as for roblox “stepping up” the issue with that is it’s making them money and they don’t care. They made game discovery worse and fucked overbdevelopers majorly a while back. Plus, a lot of these cash grabs are made so devs have funds to afford a big team and assets to make a game.",gicvigq,gicrzj2

I am just here to discuss it with people and MAYBE gain their attention on the matter. Lets be honest here. Most platforms and game developers are legit and not out to just rip the players off, the ones being sketchy are few on the market. This is not common practice for all game developers. A lot of devs frown on sketchy tactics to scratch more money out of their players. Yeah there are some bad eggs out there, but most of them know this stuff snowballs if its not taken care of early enough. Roblox is headed down that path quickly. The game is no longer perfectly safe for kids. Scammers are getting worse and devs are starting to clone their original games.",giaqxem,giaqez2

HOWEVER, there are games where strategy is needed and not just spamming stuff like the Tower Defense games and those are famous, you can make it more enjoyable for the kid to help him understand these strategies since other older kids tend to bully those who don't read these strategies(and don't bother to), and don't worry, there are google docs for strategies and a large community dedicated to writing guides for these complex games so you don't need to make things yourself.

To make it more fun for him is quite open ended. There is a subscription service for robux, once a month, could be worth looking into. Other than that, might just be a matter of finding the right games.  
As a kid I loved quick minigames and obbies. I would start with:  
Epic Minigames, The Normal Elevator, Work at a Pizza Place, Speed Run 4, Build a Boat for Treasure, Hide and Seek Extreme, and Zombie Rush.  
These are fairly old and simple, so they’re good starting points to find what kinds of games your son likes.

Also there’s games like obby where you puzzle your way around by jumping and trying not to be eliminated. 

There’s also math games, typing games, you can almost name it and find something associated with it. It took a couple of years growing up but his friends are finally old enough to pass around their Roblox usernames and now he spends a lot of time with them.

Also after some time of letting your child find their go-to favorites it isn’t all that bad to teach your child how to save or spend money by subscribing to a low tier premium pass which gives a fixed income of robux and in some games there are boosts or benefits for premium members. It’s not in a lot of games but there are some benefits to premium.

From time to time whenever I join any game I get these friend requests mostly from people that are bacons or they don't seem like they have any robux and all their clothes are free, the thing is I don't mind that at all but what I can't accept anymore is sometimes and when I say sometimes I mean pretty often someone will come to me (at any game) and ask for robux.

It gets annoying to the point where I don't want to play Roblox anymore, Roblox is my favorite game and I don't want to stop only because someone's going to walk towards me and ask for donations


If you need robux this badly why can't you ask your parents or like find a job if you're old enough like me and buy robux yourself

I am a father of a 9 yo daugher who loves adopt me.

I've read NewFissy make posts on here and clearly states the game is targeted for kids.

I play it occasionally with her, as it's actually not that bad of a game...but moreso to see how the kids go about it.

My daughter and kids love it and have a really good time playing together.

But it's pretty hectic, and I also kinda hate the develops for it at the same time. The second something new is released, my daughter, her friends and seemingly a majority of players in the game so ape shit for new stuff.

Like lately, a silly Ice Cream Truck comes in for 350 Robux. With au iTunes that's essentially $8.

Now, $8 isn't a whole lot for an in app purchase...but stuff like this rolls out regularly. Such young gamers are already getting addicted to in app purchases.

Yes, I am her parent and can simply prevent her from getting Roblox cards or iTunes cards, I know that. She will hate me for it...but I've taught her if you wait 2 weeks everyone seems to trade these 'old' items reasonably anyway.

Trading in Adopt Me is like supply and demand on crack, value of things change pretty quick.

Adopt Me also has another gaming demon, loot boxes. All of the pet eggs and even Robux purchased elements are all random. Such as buying golden fish and honey (I think that's what they are called, trying to 'win' legendary Bees & Penguins)

Our kids at such a young age are already being targeted for lottery based mechanics. 

Is anyone worried this is a bad thing for our kids?

Or just accept that's how gaming is now so sooner they learn about it the better?",N/A,N/A

Lootcates, micro-transactions, they are all very common in games across the board, in and outside of ROBLOX. As a player, these are very enticing, however there is a trick to saving your wallet--setting hard limits.

&#x200B;

Think about ROBUX as cash, set an allowance for how much she will recieve a month(or at any normal interval). Teach her that she should save some of her ROBUX each month(or interval of choice), and the more she saves, the more she will have to spend in case of new features and item releases.

Doing this will benefit her; it starts to teach her how to manage money from a young age and help her not live from paycheck to paycheck when she gets older.",fef93fz,N/A

I have two 16 year olds.  I put limits on their screen time and only let them play age-appropriate titles and when they would need to be disciplined, it was the first thing to go.  This fed the addiction and made unplayable games sought after at friends' houses which led to lots of deception and such.

&#x200B;

Now I also have a 5 year old and never put limits on the games he plays at all.  He has a 3ds and switch and pc since he was 3 and spends far less time playing games than his brothers who are almost always on the phone, computer, xbox, etc.  My youngest son doesn't lie to play games or lie about the games he plays because he doesn't have to.  He played scary games and had nightmares for a few weeks and now doesn't like scary games.

The mentality is that most people who play a game want the full experience, they want to max their stats, and they want to know what completing the game feels like.

This brings about games that have no completion state, and that constantly add more stuff to be purchased to seem like stuff the average player needs for the full experience.

As a player, here is the criteria I use to decide whether or not to buy a particular in-game item:

1. **Is it permanant?** If you buy something in-game that can be depleted(currency, fuel, etc.), you are buying directly into will of the developer of that game, and fall into the category of player that generates the majority of their game's revenue. There is no edge-case for this type of purchase, it should be avoided unless you have money to burn.
2. **Do the benefits justify the price?** Unlocking extra game content(maps, gameplay, etc.) is usually worth it. Buying upgrades, skins, and lootcrates usually aren't. Upgrades and skins, because new ones *will* come out and then you *will* be compelled to buy those as well. Lootcates because the odds of you getting a more ""rare"" item is slim, and the purchasing of enough crates to actually land a ""rare"" item will definitely waste money.
3. **Am I going to play this game in a month from now?** This is a weirdly specific question that I ask myself. Usually the answer is ""I don't know, maybe!"". If the answer is anything but ""yes"", then I wait a month and find out before making any purchases. A game that I am going to get bored of after a month, a week, or worse only place once, is not a game I should invest in. Additionally, a free game that I can't have fun in for a month without making purchases is just a money trap.

Thanks for listening to my TEDTalk, I hope after reading you have more perspective on what constitutes smarter in-game purchases.

&#x200B;

Side note: Most people absolutely hate that last question and opt to skip it entirely. *They don't care if they are going to play the game in a week, or a month, they just want to buy stuff.* If the last sentence describes you, on behalf of all of the game developers in the world, thank you for your money.",feft1v6,fefi1mp

Hi, I am a proud young father of 2 beautiful little girls. aged between 4 and 6.

I love the platform and I love the idea of being able to create your own unique experiences and sharing them with people with the same interests.

This game is something special and I am sure it is one of the biggest idea of the recent years for the gaming industry.

I am a programmer myself, so I naturally gravitate to this type of games, where the developers encourage players to create and learn different computer science skills, be it basic, or advanced (there are some really impressive stuff people have done using this engine).

My kids and I love this game, we play some servers together and enjoy customizing characters and building our own worlds.

Sadly, my wife and I are concerned about how the age rating is managed because some unapproved worlds/servers are really children friendly, but there's obviously more mature content on the platform. And I hate the fact that restricting my kids accounts will remove the fun for them (specially the older one), adding to that, it's pretty annoying having to remove and reactivate restrictions because they want to play a disneyland server and I not wanting them to get near worlds like [Elmira](https://www.roblox.com/games/7506230120/ELMIRA-Horror).

I could block certain words from the browser they use to play roblox, but they have multiple devices and that would take too much effort as well.

Why can't devs enable a parental filter using tags and give parents the option to block certain tags they don't want their children to see?

It is really not that hard, and it would take very little effort, so please consider it, young children deserve diversity, freedom and safety as well.

Kind regards.",N/A,N/A

Roblox's Lack of filtering in regards to games. Don't take my word for it, but while this may be a good idea, this is easier said than done. The problem is, Roblox does not provide anything for game developers to determine if the user is older or under the age of 13. If that would be the case, then more people (especially horror game developers) would most likely block users under the age of 13 to play these horror games.

Even when Roblox moderation is working, it does not 100% work.

I’m just a normal Roblox player, no one special. But today, I saw someone mention their full snapchat name in the Roblox Chat. This is seriously concerning. If you don’t know, snapchat is a social media which has very unique features. One of its features is it allows people to actually share their exact location on a “snapmap.”

The person who said their snapchat user in the Chat, I added him. It was exactly what I thought. It was a creepy, disgusting guy looking to find little kids to talk to. (I was on a fake account) And going back to the map, if your kid has snapchat, please make sure their snapmap is turned off and monitor your kids online activity. If you don’t know how to turn off your kids snapmap, search up a tutorial on YouTube. Yes, sadly this isn’t the only problem on Roblox but I just wanted to address another issue some parents don’t know.

There is no space for people like this in our world. Keep monitoring your children’s media use. Please stay safe. It was actually very scary talking to the guy. He said things any creep would say. 

I may make a YouTube video on this specific topic to keep parents aware of the dangers of letting your kids use the internet without being monitored. I only have 200 Subscribers so it probably won’t reach a lot of people but I want to reach as much people as I can. I’m sorry if this paragraph was a mess, I’m a teen myself.",N/A,N/A

Roblox chat system is already pretty strict, I don’t know what else do you want Roblox to do. If kids are adding random people on Snapchat, then they should know better not to add strangers or better yet shouldn’t even have an Snapchat account to begin with. Users are required to be 13+ years old create a Snapchat account, so if the kids are under the age, that ends up being the parent fault rather Snapchat or Roblox.

2. How the heck Is Roblox supposed to know that the chat had someone's Snapchat name? Roblox doesn't even allow you to say the word ""Snapchat"" in game! You expect the Roblox dev team to implement a system that scans Snapchat for all usernames and Hashtags them?
3. Roblox is a gaming platform for all ages. Banning your children from Roblox as a whole makes no sense, that's like banning your children from Youtube kids because of one video as the word ""Frick"" in it.
4. Yeah, if you don't look after your kids, they'll do some crap. 
5. I doubt, that you are a ""normal Roblox player"" or a ""teen"" Because you just sound like some Karen trying to bring awareness to a fact that harms no one!

Image moderation programs can go so far when it comes to detecting inappropriate content; which leads to countless ways for degenerates to bypass the system. No system is perfect, but what Roblox currently have is decently working. 

Roblox gets countless complaints from parents about safety concerns, but there’s a limit how much censorship you can add to a platform until you prevent players from exercising their creativity in a good way. That’s one the reasons why the Roblox chat system is so bad; half the things we say would just end up getting hashtags is because they know they have a huge children demographic.",ga9alcj,ga8wgel

I doubt that they *WANT* their store to be in the shape that it's in for example, if you search for a specific shirt you get 999 clones of the same shirt; And this suggestion is only for going forward, to go back and dig through everything might cost more than you think, and it might take years of sifting.

Once again roblox dosnt give a shit about you, They care that your account is safe and if you give them money or not. The only reason they care about your account is because without it how would you give them money?

Have a complaint or want to obtain info about somthing of yours that got moderated? Well guess what you can do! you can email them, get a botted response and thats it! Its just a waste of time. 

They wont help you even if they false moderate somthing.

You’re taking for granted how hard it is to implement an auto moderation system. Facebook one of the best social media platform in the world also struggles with moderation and constantly get backlash how horrible they are with moderating content on your platform. If you were make the moderation too strict it would result in many false-positives, but if you make to loose everything can pass through.

This has nothing to do with anything we are talking about, Roblox barely cares about those people too. 

""They actually extremely transparent"" Yes, to every except the playerbase. So in total under 1% of users

""You’re taking for granted how hard it is to implement an auto moderation system""
I already told you its garbage. If had the chance to a real human afterwards it would be great, Instead you get automated responses and ""we dont know, we cant do anything or one of those, but in a differnt language. [because once again, they outsource their moderation]

"". If you were make the moderation too strict it would result in many false-positives,"" You mean like it already has done?

"" It’s also impossible to have a human moderating every single thing that gets uploaded to roblox’s servers"" At what point did i state i wanted every single thing on roblox to be looked at by a human? I want a human to be there to look at things that DID get moderated, decide if it was false or justified. You know, like a normal company would.

""My argument still stands, it’s the best we got"" Your argument is pretty shit, Its NOT the best. Infact its one of the worst.

""Yes, Roblox sends you a ticket"" I never said anything about a ticket, Please read my previous message, I stated that they ""Responded with a botted response""[since you wernt able to comprehend this, this is AFTER the ticket] 

At no point was i complaining about a ticket. The botted response was basically ""we cant help you"" 

They terminated an account. 

That had nothing wrong with it.

Was not connected to anything bad.

And then proceeded to not be able to do anything about it.",gacurps,gacruma

Some games are great, but 99% seem like direct copies of each other or other non-Roblox games.

 Every “easy obby” game looks virtually identical with the same rainbows, same powerups, and same rewards for winning. You play one, you’ve played them all. 

Tycoon games? Step on button. Repeat.

And why doesn’t Roblox have any sort of feature to filter games? If I search “Escape Granny’s House”, I get a million copies and no way to find the “right” one.

Just from a new user experience, Roblox seems to do everything it can to push away new players—both from the Roblox side where they don’t let you filter out the mountain of garbage stolen games, and from an in-game perspective where game creators are incentivized to frustrate and milk money from players.

She was playing one of the games, and she decided to use her hard earned Robux to by ""Increased Luck"", trying to get this silly make-believe item. The time expired, and she had nothing to show for spending her Robux in the end. She was upset. I had to explain the idea of chance and that what she purchased was just increased chance of getting an item, but not a guarantee. If she started with a 5% chance, her chances were only increased to 10%, still a lousy chance. 

This seems to me nothing more than the much maligned loot box. This another form of gambling aimed at toddlers and young children. Obviously, she feels ripped off. I hate with a passion spending even a buck on Robux. These games are predatory and I've threatened many times to delete their accounts. 

The moderators are obtuse, heavy handed and capricious. I despise the way they will take a condescending attitude when punishing a child over something silly.  My daughter got banned for 3 days because she typed, ""Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"".  

I'm so ready to just delete the program. It's unfortunately a publically traded company since they are less likely to fail. If they did, I'd dance a little dance of celebration.",N/A,N/A

There are definitely good games. Apocalypse Rising, Natural Disaster Survival, Pokémon ripoffs, these were a great games where pay to win wasn't implemented. Now, its a lot worse.

There are a lot of child cashgrabs on the platform right now, but there are just as many good games that you can derive hours of fun from without spending a dime. 

I would just not let your daughter spend money on the platform, or teach her about the risks of gambling and not to spend even her own money on items that won't provide her with joy. 

There are still games and items that have been a lot of fun for me that cost ROBUX to play, but these are all much lower priced than these gambling scheme games.

Then do it. If you think that's in the best interest for your child, then stop ""threatening"" them and actually do it. Using their roblox profile as leverage for you is just bad parenting.

&#x200B;

>The moderators are obtuse, heavy handed and capricious. I despise the way they will take a condescending attitude when punishing a child over something silly. My daughter got banned for 3 days because she typed, ""Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"".

Everyone knows the automated moderation is trash, unfortunately there's not a whole lot we can do about it.

&#x200B;

>She was playing one of the games, and she decided to use her hard earned Robux to by ""Increased Luck"", trying to get this silly make-believe item.

Just because something is ""make-believe"" to you doesn't mean it means nothing to someone else. Like toys, to me since I'm 18, are a waste of time and money and I wish I learned that sooner. But to a kid (and even myself as a kid) it can make the whole day amazing.

Furthermore, if the game doesn't give the direct percent chance to obtain something when using robux (or anything that can be bought with it) then it isn't allowed on the platform, if you see a game breaking this rule, then report it. If the game isn't breaking this rule and someone still buys something to ""increase"" their luck by 5% to 10% then they know what they're getting themselves into.

Also, children under 13 aren't allowed to interact with random chance generators (at all). If a developer developed their game correctly, they will be able to deny purchases to them. So first, ensure your daughter didn't lie about het age (if she is under 13), or report the game.

If they follow all the rules, then honestly it's whoever is buying this crap that is at fault. Obviously if they're following rules then the direct percentage chances must be shown. If someone risks their robux for something that says ""10%"" then, again, they know what that are getting themselves in to.",htnkm93,N/A

The minor who was 12 and got sexually harassed on DISCORD, not Roblox. Where is discord’s liability? Not a word about their liability. Oh, and the 12 year old broke discords TOS by being under 13, but no mention of that. Roblox banned the accused off Roblox, even though that situation happened on Discord. Has Discord banned the guy, PMG should be investigating Discord. Obviously harassing or grinning anyone is not okay, it’s a sad situation, but Roblox had no control over the events happening.

Kids making games and using other kids work? Where does that happen? Twitter, and Discord. If these kids are feeling their work is being exploited, they can literally step away from the computer, talk to their parents, not develop for that person again, or go make games in Unity. Roblox also has channels developers can report other developers. But Roblox can’t monitor what people are doing on Twitter or discord.

Limiteds as gambling? That’s false. You can use currency to buy items in any online game: COD, Minecraft, Valorant, World of Warcraft, the list goes on. His claim of limiteds being gambling, doesn’t even fit the definition of gambling.

Black market? Every online game with trading has a black market. Minecraft, wow, RuneScape, new world, the list could go on for all big name games. It’s a sad situation, but if there is a demand for it, someone will make shady sites. If those sites are hosted in let’s say Russia, there is nothing Roblox can do due to international laws.

So yeah, all 4 points this guy made are garbage. This guy has a temper tantrum for 40 minutes excepting Roblox to play God and know about everything that happens off platform.

Roblox has issues, like their moderation, people begetting dmca for using assets from studio and the predator in the video had his game left up on Roblox even after his ban. But just because Roblox has issues, doesn’t mean you can blindly listen to someone lie.",htk2qg4,htjpb8l

Then they want to claim no responsibility for those that use it. That's the issue. A kids game should not be leading its players anywhere off-site since it could be potentially harmful.

Limiteds are not ""gambling"", but they are equivalent to investing. Investing and gambling both have to do with risk assessment, and kids shouldn't be dealing with assets that have real value. You're forgetting how Robux can be turned into REAL MONEY, which is not the case for any other games you listed without a black market.


>  If these kids are feeling their work is being exploited, they can literally step away from the computer, talk to their parents, not develop for that person again, or go make games in Unity.

This entire statement is just plain stupid. How are kids supposed to know if they're being exploited? Roblox doesn't help combat exploitation whatsoever and they let everything happen off site so that they're not reliable. You effectively just said that if kids are being exploited then they should just stop being exploited...

The biggest difference is Roblox is targeted towards young children, their main demographic. Comparing it to other games has no case for an argument since Roblox works fundamentally different from them.

Games such as bee swarm simulator are fun, and there's things like plane crazy. I can't offer too much considering he is quite young and multiple games I play are a bit complex and take skill and practice, such as phantom forces. But do stay away from most front page games like the anime simulators.
Also avoid ""hangout"" and ""vibe"" games they're often filled with oders(online daters) and rogangsters. Rogangster is the name given to the collective group of slenders, copy-and-pastes, and many aesthetics. Here's a rundown on them, I'd recommend watching a YouTube video about them.

Slenders all use character scaling to make themselves tall and thin. They typically OD(online date) and team in games like murder mystery 2.

Copy-and-pastes or cnps for short are pretty much the female counterpart to slenders, minus avatar size changes.

Aesthetics are in my experience typically female and are similar to cnps, though they wear typically light pastel clothes and pajamas.

Hope this helps in certain areas. Oh and stay away from games like Da Hood.",hnk9a62,N/A

3. Driving Simulator - it's not really a simulation. Driving is simple and fun. There are lots of cool cars and a pretty big map to drive around.

4. Vans World - You just simply skate around doing tricks. You can do missions, complete races, or just skate through a really well made map.

Natural disaster survival. Fun game, my 9 year old cousin loves it.

Work at a pizza place - fun game, game is basically the title, work at a pizza place. No need to use real money to enjoy this game.

Speed run 4 - fun game, even I play occasionally when my cousin has spare time.

And many more.

**Games to avoid like the plague:**

Adopt Me - Where do I start with this? Very overrated, underdelivers by a lot. Also lots of scammers in this game so I would avoid it. Also a terrible game.

Royale High - Garbage. Same as adopt me.

“Work at a Pizza Place” is a classic.

Like others have said, Natural Disaster Survival is a good one too. 

There’s some simple obbys he might like.

“Build a Cake: Back for Seconds” is a fun one too (personally i love that game for some reason)

lately i’ve done a lot of Bee Swarm Simulator.

Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 is fun

Copyrighted Artist is a good time waster with the only ability needed is being able to draw lines really. 

“The Witching Hour” and “Lab Experiment” are similar to Horrific Housing. 

But like others have suggested, avoid

•Meepcity. It’s just a weird place now which blows because it used to be fun. 
•Royale High. don’t know why but personally i play bc i like the seasonal outfits n whatnot. It’s a pretty game when my computer can run it.
•Adopt Me is.. A place.

Give me 20 seconds and i can find a NSFW model or decal.

Give me an hour and i can find 20 bypassed games.

The filtering is atrocious, I could cuss your son out if i desired and many DO people bypass the filtered chat. I recommend either checking on them once in awhile, Or finding a different game that's not on Roblox for them.

Games that your child may find entertaining and are relatively cheap/free are

Any of the balloon tower defense games, there are several.
unturned solo, servers are not recommended.
Terraria 
The Lego website used to have a few entertaining games, I don't know if it still does.
CoolMathGames.com however i believe some games are unplayable. 

Despite Roblox being targeted towards children, I really dont recommend it. I have seen predators on the site however they are rare.

*  [Super Golf!](https://www.roblox.com/games/4468711919/Super-Golf) \- it's a mini golf game with pretty easy controls on both pc and mobile, you can also load up a free private server where you can select your own rules.
* [Natural Disaster Survival](https://www.roblox.com/games/189707/Natural-Disaster-Survival) \- simple concept, fun, and there's no in-your-face monetization
* [Find The Noobs 2](https://www.roblox.com/games/1451195595/Find-the-Noobs-2) \- a bit dated now, but another simple game where you run around a map to find objects. there's multiple maps and it probably takes around 5-10hrs to find them all without help.
* [Ripull Minigames](https://www.roblox.com/games/178704642/Ripull-Minigames) \- an alternative to the already suggested [Epic Minigames](https://www.roblox.com/games/277751860/Epic-Minigames). A bit of monetization from time to time but otherwise easy to play.
* [Sled Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/6279039046/Sled-Simulator-UPDATE-5-4) \- A simulator experience that doesn't require Robux to beat the grind, no skill required as you just let the sled slide down the hill
* [Firefighters!](https://www.roblox.com/games/2166944189/Firefighters#!/about) \- You deploy from the fire station in a fire truck and put out fires and rescue people. Easy for a 5/6yo to understand the concept, and no real monetization to worry about popping up. You can also get free private servers for this to control map selection, etc.

Try to avoid letting kids at that age use the search function for games without your help. There are loads of copycat games for popular titles, and they will get confused about which one is correct and can end up in weird places. I find it's easier to get them to click the titles in the  'Discover' menu, like 'Popular' or 'Top Rated' and find something they like from there.",hnkqylf,N/A

I advise you to **NOT** these games as they might be inappropriate for your child or rely greatly on real money : 

**Adopt Me** (Has loads of scammers and getting good in-game items requires loads of robux.)

**MeepCity** (Is ruined by toxic teenagers and has been exploited multiple times to display inappropriate content)

**Any game that says ""free robux"" or has a sketchy overexaggerated title.** (a scam)

A block in time its a very fun game, but its almost a parkour game and need some skill. And more, it have alot of bug and is out of develop.

Also you can try it out some roleplay game, like underrground rp, dragon ball or something like. BUT, there are some dates, and stuff, so i dont think its a good idea.

Enjoy it and i'll edit it when i get some idea!

Edit: heya, im back.
Seeing some comments i have some ideas.

Work at a pizza place. Its a fun game, just create pizzas, but you can choose what you can do, you can choose make your pizza, delivery ingredients etc. But, it can be boring as you play it

Epic minigames. Have alot of minigames.

Bomb survival. Idk the name of the game but is fun hehe. Just avoid of the bombs.

Flood escape its a nostalgic game where you need to escape from the water that is coming. You need some skill.

Hide and seek extreme, the game that NO ONE IN THIS POST IS TALKING ABOUT. Its underrated. But dont have updates now.

Boost vector is a race game. That's it.

Thing to avoid:
Adopt me. Scams, dates, it looks good when you play it, but have alot of bad things

Meepcity. It barely has updates and have some bad things like adopt me. But its pretty meh. Just enjoy the minigames.

Royal high. Boring.

Simulator games. Its just money grabbers.

Games that say 'free robux'. Only scam. Im going to repeat some times. Scam. Scam. Scam. Scam. Scam. Scam. Scam. Scam. scam. Scam. Scam.",hnle9l2,N/A

You can build to houses, malls, restaurants, and pool places and roleplay with friends (if they also have 80 robux)

Problems: need gamepasses to get 2nd floor, basement, advenced building, premium, and radio but it's fine without

=========================

Games TO AVOID:

Adopt Me!:

Group: DreamCraft

By: NewFissy

Reason:

A lot of scammers and a lot of trading and no one roleplays anymore and potions cost real money

Any ""Free robux"" games:

Reason:

Every ""Free Robux"" game is probably a scam and will steal your account when you give your pass

Da Hood:

Group: Da Hood Entertainment

By: Benoxa

Reason:

A lot of Slenders, Rogangsters, and Copy and Pastes (CnPs)

MeepCity:

By: alexnewtron

Reason:

A lot of online daters, slenders, and Copy and Pastes (CnPs) and poles and bypassed clothes like ""Milkie's"" which are supposed to shape like boobs

Any ""Hangout"" games

There also full of a lot of online daters, slenders, and Copy and Pastes (CnPs)

And I'm gonna explain what's a slender:

A Slender is a Roblox Avatar style that is tall and skinny with a face called ""Stitch face"" or how some people call it ""Railroad face"" and also has a missing leg, the people who use this type of style are mostly toxic and team in Murder mystery 2 (MM2) which most people hate and also pretends to be 18+

An often heard phrase ""Mic up"" is when a slender thinks they can scare you with their forced deep voice which should not work on you.

BUT not all slenders are bad, they just simply like the avatar or uses it for fun because it's just a style, Do NOT hate on slenders for no reason at all ONLY if they are toxic. Don't act like a idiot, get help, touch some grass.

Credit to [Da Hood Fandom wiki for this bit!](https://da-hood-roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Slenders)

A Copy and Paste (CnPs) are a girl version of Slenders which are less taller

An Online dater has been in the site longer then a Slender or a Copy and Paste (CnPs) and they wear an Avatar style that has a Holiday Crown and a Paper boat in there heads (btw there are people who use Holiday crowns and Paper boats that are not online dating) and they have unofficial ""Nike"" or ""Adidas"" shirts and pants (btw there are also people who wear ""Nike"" and ""Adidas"" shirts and pants that are not online date)

Roblox doesn't care about users, Removal of events shows they dont want to put effort into the community anymore. Removal of tix showed they want less creative avatars and more pay2play. There's a reason bots were a major issue for months with roblox only adding a shitty captcha that could be botted easily.

I think you should play roblox with your daughter because you would be able to **friend her and see her activity.** This way you could see when she is playing, what she is playing.

Been playing roblox for ages on and off with a friend we are both in our twenties and we come back to it from time to time its ""old reliable"" and I feel I have some sound advice from the time we have played.

 Being honest not all of the games are bangers haha most of them are a cash grab for that sweet sweet robux but there are some hidden gems for sure some talented creators thrive on roblox so you will find something sooner or later its always great to find a competent game thats easy to enjoy and fun to play.

 The major concern as a parent is well we have seen some s#*t on some of the roleplay ""rp"" games for sure Id avoid those at all cost, for children especially, unless you are willing to give alot of time supervising them because many have uhhh ""adults"" prowling about for young and impressionable minds if you catch my drift... me and my friend always mess with these scum as hard as we can  most of the time its so obious it hurts, but not much can be achieved anyway because impressive chats censor system things crazy most of the worst words and slang as well as the abilty to give a adress is blocked a pretty well even more so on younger aged accounts.

Buuut on the other side of the coin its a great tool exercise social skills and with some supervision and a little stranger danger talk here and there alot can be learned and good practices can be exercised this way but regardless I think you can disable the chat altogether anyway.

Good parts of ROBLOX:
You get to spend more time with your kid, which is great. There's a plethora of different games you guys can choose. I recommend playing Epic Minigames, as most people who play it are chill, and the Minigames are very fun. There's actually many great educational ROBLOX games. I know a museum game that gives lessons about wildlife and it's huge, I could go get the link for you if you want. Also, a decent chunk of the ROBLOX community are normal people.

The bad side:
Many people bypass things like inappropriate usernames, NSFW audio or images, and slurs or curses. It honestly disgusts me, as ROBLOX is meant to be safe for all ages.There's millions of user-generated games, but that doesn't necessarily mean a good thing. You wanna watch out for role-playing games, like Meepcity or Roblox High School, as they're infested with online daters. Also, there's bypassed games called ""condo games,"" which use scripts so that characters show up with reproductive organs & can have sexual activity. There are many edgy kids on ROBLOX but if they do anything too bad, you can always just block them so that their chat doesn't show up. Or you could just join a new server. Lastly, ROBLOX's security is by far, one of the worst ever. A friend of mine got banned from Roblox for saying ""oofers oofy,"" while people who play pornographic audio in-game are untouched. The report system is broken, and support/moderation never listens to you unless you're a YouTube content creator.",gj3eq3p,N/A

Lol After dinner and baths we pop some popcorn (or whatever snack), gab our pad/phone/console/laptop, hop on our personal accounts and have at it. Always a fun time and they love it. Also helps me know more what they are playing to not only monitor but give myself more ground to talk to them about their interests. You know, really know the characters and story line to some of their favs. (They are finally getting out of FNAF...ty sweet baby Jesus for that!) I truly teel like it has paved the way for them to connect to, as well as feel comfortable and open with me.",gj3kybw,N/A

it’s very fun to play if you’re playing the right games. I play roblox with my brother a lot.

my brother likes to play games that uses “imagination” (building games) so I suggest you try doing that with your daughter.

Avoid the crappy games that make you try and buy stuff.

they’re usually called “play obbyfor prize1!!!!1!” Or “build to survive” with build being spammed underneath it.

As for the later half paragaph you brought up ""oders"" and im saying there's no such thing as a ""peak for oders"", the way they act and dress just changes and they will just get worse as time passes on

And today, same thing. Though you'd probably get better luck in some games more than others.

I wish there was some sort of way to counteract scamming more than just them saying to be careful. My daughter and I have played for years, her more than me. And for the first time, she got scammed, bad. Her whole entire pet collection in Adopt Me. My hands went to my face the moment she mentioned her whole pet collection for 100k diamonds in Royale High. I gotta say tho, the scammer went as far as meeting up in royale high and starting trade, putting the 100k diamonds in, then waiting till the last second to bail. Said it was getting late and theyd do it again in the morning. They met her in the morning and tried again then promised after school. Well, they unfriended her. And her heart broke and I felt so bad for her. Me personally, I wouldn't bite if someone offers me all them diamonds for my entire pet collection. But she did it. And even though I have their username and account name I feel it's so pointless to try anything. And I mean really what is there. Reporting won't get her stuff back either.

I donated 10 more and I brought them to my stand in game but then they left. At first i was sad but later i was fine but i for sure learned to be more careful,iyi4nkf,N/A

Of course it'd be better to just live in a scam-free world, and this is absolutely not justifying the bad people who scam on Roblox (they suck bigtiiime), but I have a feeling this event will stick with your daughter and she'll be much more aware of scammers online after this.

Ever since then, I've been very, very wary of scammers.

There really needs to be a way to set limits or require a pin on in-game purchases that use Robux. Id like to buy robux for my Kid but with how poorly Roblox regulates their game makers it is not safe at all. Too many games out there that will pop up a random in game useless item for  200 Robux that is one time use hoping a kid accidentally clicks buy  trying to get back into the game. Not to mention some games just  absolutely spam you with ingame purchase popups ever 2 seconds. If there  was a parental pin requirement option for using robux id be much more comfortable putting real money into the game.",N/A,N/A

Something like this happened to me, just a different scenario. 
I was playing a game on Roblox with my VR headset. Everything was great until I left the game and noticed that my robux went down. I apparently bought something, but I didn't see any pop-ups on my screen. Robux completely wasted and I'm scared I will lose a bigger amount next time I play in VR. 

Roblox really should make a toggle on/off feature that will let you purchase stuff in games to prevent from unwanted/accidental purchases and those annoying pop-ups.

It is the parent's fault for giving their child tons and tons of robux and expecting it to last a lifetime when their child likely doesn't understand how currency works (like how children normally don't understand how currency works).

It didn't automatically accept you just clicked the white button instead of the gray button. I don't see how you are able to get the gray button on the left mixed up with the white button on the right unless you're colorblind, can't read, and don't know the difference between right/left.

If you want to buy you click the white if you don't want to buy you click the gray/black, it is simple and easy to remember.

Blox Fruits: I hate it even though it's a decently coded game,  although I don't think it deserves THAT many players so I'd say not deserved. Maybe like 120K-210K would be deserved.

Adopt Me: Not the best but I can tell a lot of work went into it. Deserved.

Royal High (Or Royalloween): Just meh, It's fine. I can tell a decent amount of work is in it so I guess Deserved

Bloxburg: I'm a little bit biased because it's my favorite game but I think it's very deserved. It is a very good game and even though it's not free 25 Robux is literally under a dollar (CAD) and it's still a work in progress. Very much deserved.

Brookhaven: Ehhh. I can see the appeal but I think it's kind of lazily coded. I mean it's decent but for being the second most popular game on Roblox It looks like shit compared to the other games. I'd say not deserved

And finally Evade: Pretty good game actually!, Not exactly my type of game but I'd say it's still really good. I understand why so many people like it. Deserved!",irk3m0h,N/A

Blox Fruits copies an anime that is actually made well.

Adopt Me - Was better in its first years, before pets were used as local currency

Royale High - Probably fun enough

Bloxburg - Fun when you're not alone (If we can give some interesting facts while we're at it, The Sims 4 are going free-to-play starting October 18th)

Brookhaven - Unplayable alone

Evade - Fun when you're not alone

Evade is a fun game. Though it can get boring for a bit as all the nextbots do the same thing. I can see why people play it as some can't buy GMod. But just play GMod for the experience if you can afford it or have it.

Adopt me is well, adopt me. one of the addicting kids games on roblox, with no real purpose other than to gamble for virtual dragons that are cyberpunk 2099 colors, not deserved.   


I've never played Royal High, but I think I've got the general idea, Highschool. That's it. Not deserved.  


Welcome to Bloxburg is surprisingly worthy of the deserved, it IS basically Royal High but more life based. You build your house, get a job, get depressed, so on. Game has a point, get money to build house. Personally not my cup of tea, but deserved in some aspects.  


Brookhaven is essentially Bloxburg but more roleplayish and you can't build a house other than just choose the model of the house, and you can't get a job or be depressed (unless you're an edgy 10 year old who played Shadow the Hedgehog). Not Deserved.  


Evade is Garrys mod without the freedom to spawn in a bunch of half life zombies along side some red barrels and make em go kaBOOM.

Blox Fruits - Pretty fun and well made game, definitely the best anime game on roblox currently. Although i do think 600k+ concurrent players is a bit too manh weebs to my personal liking lol -- Kind of deserved

Brookhaven - Trash game. Looks like something made in 2012 using free models and the most prehistoric scripting imaginable -- Not deserved

Welcome to Bloxburg - Probably the best rolaplaying/building game on roblox. Even i, a strategy/rpg enjoyer play it sometimes just to decorate my house for the season, even if no one is going to see it lol -- Deserved

Evade - Nextbots are the peak of horror. It is unarguable that being chased by a screaming, 2D dababy in a closed space is WAY more scary than being chased by slenderman in a forest. The game is pretty fun too -- Deserved

Royale High - Very well made roleplay game, although the ""magic highschool"" vibe was never my favorite. The devs did a fantastic job briging out said vibe into life -- Deserved

Games i think should be there:
Loomian Legacy
Doors
Dungeon Quest
Tower Heroes
Tower Blitz
Lumber Tycoon 2
Theme Park Tycoon 2

It's really easy to beat when you know how to deal with all the monsters. There is no thrill to it except maybe for that one guy who chases you through rooms rush and and ambush are just png's. And I know the recent popularity in pngs chasing you but I feel like i the devs were just being lazy with them. That goes with enemy animations as well. It's just not that well made as a game. But there is an upside. To revive yourself in bame is only 30 robux which is very generous compared to other games. And the idea of ai generation for levels is also pretty cool.,irme0gx,irknzky

Let’s take Midnight Horrors for example, another survive the killers formula game, which has 450+ killers, with the whole idea for (mostly a joke game) having really unique and cool ideas to threaten the player with, 200+ maps, all at different sizes and even have traps on some of them, to further threaten the player. Midnight Horrors also has around 150 emotes, all costing survivals, with the most expensive being 25000, a goal not many have reached but it keeps the player playing. All of this put together really gives the player something to come back to again and again as you could play for years and not experience all maps or killers (emotes probably not) as there is just so much. Compared to evade, I think this has way more replayability and is just more fun in general since you’re just running away from randomised bots that just chase you, whereas you have killers like Ashpit, who do nothing themselves to kill the players, but they spawn humanoid ash creatures (no idea what to call em) that hunt players around the map, and Ashpit spits fire around the map periodically, where if the ash creatures were to make contact with this fire, they will ignite and will turn into a ticking time bomb. (Also the fire ignites the player for about 10s if they step on it.)",irn0ai2,irkjxzp

Evades maps are inferior in count, yes, but the amount of detail they have in them is perfect for certain gameplays (even if people keep voting for the same three maps). A good example of map knowledge is by juking one nextbot and keeping it busy while the others revive the incapacitated.

Emotes shouldn’t be the thing keeping the players from playing. This isn’t TTD 3.

As for the killers themselves, their concept have been in almost every single “horror” game in Roblox that they just… stop being unique in their own accord. They’re scary, yes, but do they offer anything new to the table?

The point of Nextbots was to turn something hilariously mundane (a literal comedic schtick) into something terrifying. A playground filled with kids and you’re out here being chased by a loud vacuum cleaner endlessly looping an earraped Taco Bell sound effect — a ridiculous description, but it tricks the player’s brain into either engaging their humour, fight or flight response, or run for their lives.

Complexity ≠ Better. Another huge reason for Evade’s popularity is its simplicity and easy learning curve - it perfectly mimics Gmod (and Source games in general)’s nature. You jump in, play, and have fun. No need to heavily strategize which could lead to serious tilting because the RNG just wasn’t in your side. It doesn’t slap you with anything nor do you have to meticulously learn each and every single “villain” which, depending on the player, could take a long time.

Play Evade with your friends next time. You’ll see what I mean.",irn5sg1,irn0ai2

3/07/23  
So, I got an email from a fake roblox support trying to get into my account. And, I almost fell for it. One I was rather tired because I just got off work so I didn't think nothing of it at first. Notice I didn't put any information into this scam, because I was on my phone. One thing with me I never use my phone for Roblox, just only on PC is where I play it on. So, I got out of my bed and went to my computer to see in better detail what was this email was about. 

[This is the email that I got on 3\/07\/23. Notice I've blocked out the user that supposed to take a hold of my account. I also blocked my name out for confidentiality reasons.](https://preview.redd.it/odjyh2linyma1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc648cd996ff9e59ed5bd26ecc3693e9d7c37e5d)

So, I noticed it when I was on my computer and the first things I did was go to Roblox Support and made a ticket to report this issue and hopefully this might address the potential threat for younger people that don't read as well, and maybe it got into a parent's email and they don't understand so normally they would click that link and put the old password in and as well new password and so forth. That would given this user access to the person's account. And, they can wreck havoc by stealing your limited items, your robux and even your group funds if you aren't aware. So, I also reported this to discord servers that I will not discuss until there's further explanation about this scam. Now, the next day follows up. 

[Due to reasons I also blocked the person replying to me for confidentiality. This was on 3\/08\/23 so a fast response.](https://preview.redd.it/marewm9uoyma1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b8bd94c40daad08b33ad48376af20d24f1f6ee4f)

But, what drove me up the wall was first of all this was sent to me by email. This has nothing to do with reporting a user on their site. Like to my first opinion like ""Did they even read it to begin?"" The biggest problem what I have is how did this user get my email. I don't give my email out to anyone. So it scratch my head for quite a bit. So, I did reply to them explaining like how can I report this user on your site when the person doesn't exist, as well too... This was done by email. Plain and clear \*\***Email\*\*.** And these scammers are really smart now, they take the item away of what ever you own and if it's a large enough item most likely they would sell it for USD. And, then all the smaller items that would sell them for small amounts to get all that robux and then use that robux and buy something from an alt account until that account gets into the main account of the scammer. So, it's very well planned out. So, I emailed them again complaining towards them about this issue and this is the outcome of the current of my ticket.  


[3\/09\/23 Yet again quick response I'll give them that. Names blocked out again.](https://preview.redd.it/dlouuqdcqyma1.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=85324132c1d8622c5a4e701e41c71d682116f5b9)

What drove me up the wall this time, this roblox support agent pretty much replied the same person up above did. By saying if you want to make a report use the ""Report abuse"" on their site. And yet again I told them again... 1. This came from email 2. How can I report someone that doesn't exist 3. How did this user somehow find my personal email.  
Like, don't get me wrong. I know that Roblox Support Team does thousands of email replies of tickets so I know they have to put of what they think goes to that topic and severity. But, the issue on hand is I didn't get any help from a higher user on the Roblox Team to address this issue. I've been playing Roblox for 14 years and still to this day, and I still enjoy it. I even got a hat published and that made my world go beyond. Sadly, I didn't get a free copy of the item with most people that made items. \*sometimes\* 

Of what this whole thing whole thing comes towards in my own personal opinion there should be a log of severity of the issue that the Roblox Team can reach out to and send their findings towards a department that understands more and might shine some light on it. Instead of giving me the same thing twice... It just strikes me odd that of this very bad issue happening to countless others that fall for this they would have some sort of protection to fight against this. And I know that these scammers are getting smarter and better at their tactics fooling people. If someone in Roblox Moderation would gladly explain all this to me of how their system works of the severity of this please do. The longer we wait, more users would see this email and get their stuff stolen and just make them quit the game.

Thanks so much if you read all this rant I did. I just need to someone to actually see what in the world is going on, and how we can help as a community to prevent scammers and hackers like this. Thanks again and hope this might shine some light and help anyone that has fallen towards this.",N/A,N/A

Hi.

I currently pay for 3 roblox premium accounts. 2 for my daughters and one for my partners son. 

Today is as they call it ""robux day"" when they all get there 1000 robux. After checking why my daughter told me hers had not came in, I noticed a purchase for a weird tshirt with an owl on it for 1002 robux. 

When I click on the shirt it's back to 80 robux. 

I have changed her password, turned on 2 step verification and sent an email explaining what has happened to Customer Service. She is rather upset. 

Will she get her Robux back from Customer Service or should I buy her another 1000 Robux?",N/A,N/A

* Sharpshooter Mines
* Databrawl
* Doomspire Brick Battle
* Framed
* Whatever Floats your Boat

Natural disaster survival: you get put on a pretty small map with a varying amount of disasters happening, these can go from tornadoes to volcanic eruptions 

Epic mini games: these are a collection of small mini games that can 30 seconds- a minute 30 these can be team games, free for all games, or just survival games, a nice little collection and most of the games are explained pretty well

Speed run 4: this game is a collection of races where you run and jump through obstacles to get to the end, it’s a ton of fun and gets gradually harder.

World//Zero is kinda like those cliche RPGs with magic and swords

Vesteria is like World/ but not >!hard to explain!<

Ronopoly is Monopoly

Word Bomb is like Scrabble but you're timed

Copyrighted Artists is where you draw something based off the prompt and copy someone else's drawing without knowing the prompt, but I wouldn't recommend letting a kid play that, because sometimes people are dumb and draw very inapp stuff in there

Apples to Pairs is like apples to apples, a kid friendly version of cards against humanity

Cenozoic Survival is basically a survival game where you play as animals in the Cenozoic era

Vampire Hunters 2/3 is a game where there is a vampire trying to kill you and you have to find out who it is without getting killed >!like among us but I'm pretty sure it's older than among us!<

Tradelands is a game with pirates and trading teams, pirates steal from traders and sell them to NPCs for money while traders ship items to other ports. You can also trade with other people for rare weapons, furniture, and the like

Wild West is like Red Dead, a game taking place in the wild west

And that's all I can think of at the moment

Oh yeah some games you should stay *very* far away from are **MeepCity, free ROBUX games, club games, lounge games** (i think that's what they're called), and **games that have a bigger dislike ratio to like**, because that **usually means that there's people online dating and some other.. inappropriate things there**",go5y2h4,N/A

If there isn't a game you are looking for you could always make one which I can say from experience I've learned more scripting and useful things than my school is teaching me.

If you can touch-type and want to actually learn something that takes time and skill it’s great. All you do is get a sheet up (a string of numbers and letters arranged in such a way that the buttons you press will play the intended song) and practice. I can even send you some good sheet repositories, if you’re interested.

Vesteria is probably the best MMO game at the moment, in my view. My only issue with it is that it’s not particularly quest-based.

Caliber is a pretty good FPS. As is Energy Assault.

Outlaster is a game based on the show of the same name. It’s exactly the same, idols, voting system, challenges and all. Can take a while to figure out if you’re not familiar with the show but can get super intense and strategic, especially when you start using more social game to bend votes your way. 

Star Wars: Battlefield is another good FPS.

Specter is a Phasmaphobia remake, arguably the best one on the platform.

Shoot Out! is personally my favourite FPS: cartoon style but very polished and exciting.

Project Lazarus is COD Zombies, if that’s your thing.

State of Anarchy is Escape from Tarkov but the last time I played it you couldn’t save gear or anything, it’s just sort of a free for all. Not sure if it’s been updated.

Theme Park Tycoon 2 is great. It turns into Planet Coaster when you buy the disable collisions game pass that allows you to place stuff inside one another and wherever you want.",go5v8jk,N/A

* Phantom Forces. Reasonably paced FPS game, but be aware if you do too good and are a rank <140 you will probably get kicked by salty kids.The community is absolute shit, would not recommend going into small servers. VIP is expensive asf too.
* Vehicle Simulator. A car game, basically racing and driving.A lot of customizability.Beware of glowstick ricers and slap-any-wing-on-anything ricers, may cause brain cell depletion.
* Driving Simulator, VS but with better graphics and map design. Note that DS has very little customization options, side effects include less ricers.
* Energy Assault. FPS game with energy weapons. You sort of need good aim as the weapons dont really  deal a lot of damage, so hit your shots.
* Build A Boat For Treasure. Offers team build, basically you build a boat and try to survive the course for gold, which can be used for more materials.

From the same creators as Call of Robloxia 5. Do you think they’re not trying to copy it now?

They were in fact so similar that when the game released in 2015, one of the devs at DICE had an interview where he expressed annoyance at PF for being incredibly obviously a battlefield clone.

Excuse me if I come off like a noob or someone who's just clueless but I just came back home after being away for a few years and I'm finding out that my nephew - who's parents aren't doing the most bang up job, but what can you do when everyone coddles the kid and doesn't lay down some law - absolutely loves playing this game.

Last time I visited, he literally spent the whole visit just playing this game, he appeared to at least know what he was doing, not doing it well obviously, but doing whatever it is you do in this game.

I figured I'd make a post and try to see what I can learn about this from you guys. Is this a good game for a kid his age to be playing? It looks like minecraft and I know lots of people let their kids that age play that (bear in mind, I grew up playing all sorts of video games so I'm not one to judge or really care) Is there anything I can help him with or show him to not bother people who actually play this game seriously? Any fun stuff I could show a 5 year old that would give me some cool uncle points?

Let me reiterate, I'm sorry if I come off as noobish or condescending, I've just never even heard of this game until now and my nephew isn't inherently a bad kid, he's just got 2 parents not doing such a great job and I'd hate for this game that he loves have a negative impact on him.

But yeah if he just sticks with the games that are on the front page he should be fine - I assume there are many others around his age also playing them as they are the easiest to find and aimed at his age group.

Edit: actually one thing you could show him is if you click ""Catalog"" on the website, then click ""Featured"" then click the drop-down menu on the right and click ""Price (low to high)"" there should be some free items he can get for his character",d5gbu1f,N/A

Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/10oafpi/im_so_done_with_this_rb_battles/,I'm so done with this. (RB Battles),WhyDoesLifeSuckX,2023-01-29,1675006596.0,7,"I'm so done with this. (RB Battles)
First of all, lemme clarify, I have no problem with the event, the judges did a great job, except from the fact that my fps is like 10 when I attempted the final battle.

I sacrificed my sanity and my time just so I could play the final battle, Oh wait. My parents won't let me stay up even though I let them know at least a week in advance (because of the delays)

So I woke up the next day and I see that not many people have completed but because I missed all the streams and nobody posted guides.

After a while, I started to figure out all the steps, some of which were ridiculously hard to figure out by yourself. Then, by the time I'm at the final battle against JP, with having completed everything previously at 17 fps, my fps drops to 10, and I see that around 5k players have gotten the gold crown, which was what I was aming for. Also at around this time was when the first guides started popping up which, sadly I didn't need. And then I found out there was parkour. 

That was it.  Game Over.

Ggs to all who got the gold crown and hood. 

I might try to get the crown post nerf, but this event didn't work out for me.

Solid 10/10 for the experience though but I was playing on mobile so I couldn't see all the good stuff.

Have a happy rest of your day, to anyone who reads this far",N/A,N/A

Firstly, the only problem with your script is that ""CanColide"" should be spelled ""CanCollide"".

Now, in terms of better habits:  
\- change `wait(3)` to `task.wait(3)`  
\- change `script.parent` to `script.Parent`

you could also just do:  
`Platform = script.Parent`

`while task.wait(3) do`  
`Platform.CanCollide = not Platform.CanCollide`  
`Platform.Transparency = math.abs(Platform.Transparency - 1)`  
`end`

My daughter signed up for Roblox when she was eight years old. Both my wife and I checked and the game seemed very age appropriate. And it is! It's child-friendly and lots of fun. My daughter has friends at school who play and they play together online. My daughters spent months building her account.

And my daughter is crying because of it and I feel like a rotten parent.

A friend came over and, without asking, signed my daughter out so that they could play. But my daughter doesn't remember her password. So when I contacted Roblox support and in their reply:

> To assist with or provide information about any account, we must first verify account ownership. Unfortunately, there is no email address or purchase information associated with the account. Without this information, we are unable to verify ownership or assist further with the account.

Naturally, my eight year old daughter doesn't have an email address or a credit card! But still, there response was actually very reasonable. We don't want account hijacking. But I can imagine quite a few parents in this situation. **However** ...

In July of 2019, Roblox sent _me_ an email stating that my child had signed up for an account and provided _my_ email address as the parent.

Ah, great! This is what  I needed! I hadn't seen that email back then, but I was searching for anything about Roblox and found it. It also helpfully included a ticket number on the button to click to verify.

So I provided Roblox with this information, the ticket number, and I sent the email from the _the email address they sent this to_. They still refused, even though I'm supposed to be able to help her with a password reset.

When I again reminded them about the ticket number and that they could verify the information, they not only (again) didn't mention the ticket number, but wrote:

> Thank you for writing back to us.

> We're sorry but we're unable to provide you with any further information or response regarding this inquiry. We encourage you to review the previous information sent to you as we have provided you with all that we can at this time.

Some lazy damned support person can't be bothered to look up my details, even though I gave him the ticket number with the verification code.

I think this is a terribly shitty way to treat customers and my daughter's crying because of this. I've also tried reaching out to Roblox on Twitter, but I doubt that will get any response.

Sorry for venting. Just needed to get this out of my system.

There are a lot of children on Roblox, yes, but there are also a lot of adults as well and it is by far NOT a child friendly platform. I'm a parent and when my daughter wanted to create an account a couple of years ago I signed up with her and  have played with her and a lot happens in the chat that they try to censor, but people have definitely found ways around that to bully and harass. A lot of the more popular games get scammers and hackers, as well. So, please be very careful with your 8 year old on Roblox. You can go into the settings and turn the chat feature off. Players can also send each other private messages. You can turn that feature off as well. There is still some potentially icky content on the platform if you look deep enough - really the best I can advise you is please be watchful. Roblox is not a children's game.",fi9seo7,N/A

Before then there are parent accounts(needed to enable full chat for 13<) where you can control your children's accounts. Dunno why they discontinued them, maybe they allow hackers to get on. If Roblox still has parent accounts it may save some headaches. And when parent accounts existed all forgot password email directed to parent's email if I recall correctly.

So -- It seems that Roblox is making a big effort to get their development in front of kids.  They have a whole section of their website dedicated to teacher outreach including lesson plans.


My son, 7, is very into Roblox, and we spent a good chunk of today (his fall break) developing a Roblox game.  It's a ridiculous game, just a bunch of random prebuilt items over a weird terrain.  When I went to publish it, it is saying that the age restriction on it is undetermined.

I have his account locked down to the recent parental controls which only allows games that are suitable for all ages.  I caught him on some pretty questionable games, certainly not age appropriate.

When I went to the creator questionnaire, it told me that I basically need 100,000 plays to set the age restriction of my game.  That sucks -- so I either remove the parental controls on my 7 year old, or he can not play his own game that he worked hard on.

So -- is there some way to get around this not-being-able to set the age restriction myself, or some way to whitelist certain games that aren't in his permission level?  I'm really stuck here.  If anyone can help, we'd greatly appreciate it.",N/A,N/A

I'm pretty sure there are settings you can use to tailor your childs experience into something safer, but I would mostly just recommend joining her in the games occasionally, and letting her know what behavior is okay and what behavior isn't. Gaming anywhere online is a community effort and learning etiquette, safety, and how to tell when something is ""off"" is definitely a skill I wish my parents had raised me with.

So take every “I haven’t encountered one” with a small grain of salt. But personally I’ve never witnessed any blatantly suspicious activity in this game.

And Roblox is very good about censoring personal info in chat but sometimes stuff does get through. Teach your kids what personal info is and why they shouldn’t send it, and how to block people that they feel uncomfortable around.

First, understand what Roblox is. Roblox is a game marketplace. It has thousands of games within itself that generally look very similar to eachother. Every user account has a character or avatar that the player can dress up with moderated clothing and accessories options from the shop. It has obstacle course “obby” games, role-playing games, party games, coloring games, dress up games, tycoon games, “horror” games, and many other types of games. And they’re all developed by 3rd party developers (not roblox). There are obstacles in place that make it extremely difficult to nearly impossible for people or kids to upload games with inappropriate photos, words, etc. 

As far as toxicity and bullying goes, from what I’ve experienced usually direct competition games that have significant idle time for standing around and chatting have the most “toxic” kind of people that *can* sometimes use harassment, report baiting, etc to try to get other competitors down. (That Outlaster game, that Elimination Tower game, Dodgeball, etc). It’s not common place but still. They give off obnoxious teen type vibes. You might not encounter them a lot but when you do.. Leave, and teach your kids to just leave.  If it’s a popular game try to move to a different server with different players.

Some players in that Brookehaven game, and some other role playing games, can get a bit pg-13 at times. Some “vibe” type games can also be the same.",ipw8rtd,N/A

some people will be creepy, but most aren’t- just depends on what types of games and people she is interacting with. personally, my sister is about to be 8 in january and i’ve disabled her chat (available in privacy or security settings) and it’s helped a lot. i let her have a chat for a while and everyday she would be super irritable. she also gets scammed on adopt me frequently, (even if you tell them it’s a scam sometimes they’ll still do it) and that would upset her so much. disabling chat has helped a lot though. 

most of the inappropriate games are hard to find, and they get moderated super fast. if you decide to still have the chat on, closely monitor what’s going on- talk to her about internet safety, when to block someone and all the generic safety.

I've started using skype at around 8 too, and talked to a lot of strangers I've met in games. They were pretty cool, and I just had luck. The oldest one I met and talked to (on voice chat) was not even 20!

I was just lucky that I didn't have a mobile phone to take pictures, and didn't encounter any bad actors. If she uses anything similar to Discord to talk to her friends, I suggest you check it regularly if you don't really trust her, or have your suspicions.",ipv6z6u,N/A

But to answer the question; yes. I play the game myself and when I see someone being creepy I call it out immediately, and have had to do so a number of times. 
There’s a number of things in the Roblox settings that you can do to protect your child, one being turning off chats. That’s what I would do, even if they’re talking to her- they can’t get any information because she can’t talk back. It’s sad that has to be done but Roblox’s rating is going up to 16+ I think or 17, you should check out the Roblox website for as much information as you can. Good luck. <33",ipx7pa3,N/A

Also, Roblox has privacy settings so you can turn off the chat/turn off the ability for others to message your daughter privately.

(I don't know what device you're on but here's how to access settings from a laptop/computer)

Settings (Gear icon) > Privacy > There are chat/messaging settings. You can also change these settings to just friends so she can talk to friends if she has any friends that play.

My experience with the game generally is that it can be pretty toxic at times and a lot of people try to ruin the experience with others. My only advice really is just monitor as much as possible, along with changing the privacy settings. In terms of the chat systems themselves, they're pretty heavily filtered to the point that some innocent things even get censored so there shouldn't be any worries there. Very very occasionally I end up encountering someone who manages to evade the filter (Both situation were people calling me a slur in regard to pride items) But it's extremely rare it happens- changing the settings should eliminate it all together if chat is completely off/she can only chat with friends.",ipwddju,N/A

So not only do they not have a ""delete account"" option online... they also want you to jump through several extra hoops to delete your account. 

Even if you live in the EU and have GDPR on your side (or elsewhere with similar legislation).

With other companies you just log in, find the ""delete my account and associated data"" button, click it, and it's done... but nope... not with Roblox...

Really poor customer service, in this day and age, honestly! 😠

He should stop crying about it and learn to cope/ not letting his frustration out on others. 

If you looking for tips to give him, there's how some mentioned ways to get Robux like Microsoft Rewards. To get more Robux a bit quicker I recommend using apps where you can earn money for playing games. I used Mistplay and and had enough points in barely a week to claim a 10€ play store card that I used to buy Robux. However it's something you need patience for (like anything else free) and you shouldn't expect too much Robux of it.
If he needs more Robux and quicker he should just buy himself Robux with his own  money
If he doesn't stop he seems like an overall annoying person I'd block. Also very immature of him to cry about Robux",j1h49id,N/A

I am really infuriated. Roblox refuses to reset my parental pin that I have set for my self. Now, here's the context:

My cousins and sister's accounts were being breached, so in fear of having my account breached, I created a parental pin. This was 3 years ago. Yes, I should have created a 2FA key; but, I did not want to go through the hassle of linking up all that jizz. My account age is <13, and my 10-year-old self decided to change the date to the date I created my account; it was created around 2012-2014. 

Now it's 2023, and I completely forgot the Pin. Roblox refuses to reset as they, ""do not reset pins upon user request"". Which is a lot of bull crap in my opinion. No where on the ""I Forgot the PIN"" Roblox page, does it state that they are not able to. I even mentioned my ""irl"" age, but the best they could do is, ""Roblox does not reset pins upon user request"". But of course! I can totally ask my parents who are refugees and totally know how to use a video game website! Even after informing my plight, Roblox refuses. I've sent over 4-5 tickets over the course of 1-2 years, and nothings changed. I've been honest and honesty seems to be the terrible choice when it comes to Roblox.

Have you all ever experienced the same issue? And yes, you can down vote me.",N/A,N/A

Yes, I admit, it was my fault as well. I should have created a 2FA key, or generated a backup code.   


And Roblox's rules are very vague. According to COPPA Regulations, a child is considered the age of 13 and under. No where on the Roblox page states who falls under the category for requiring a parental pin, nor any potential situations may face my similar plight.

Ok. So my daughter is 8 years old and loves Roblox. I play with her occasionally. We have purchased robux for her several times, usually $10.00 USD worth, so 800 Roblox. Total, over the last few years, we have probably purchased $300.00 worth of robux. Today, she brought to my attention of some face for her avatar that costs 90000 robux!!! Of course her and all her friends in school want this item. My question is…..why is a child’s video game charging over $1000 USD in robux for a freaking stupid avatar face!?!?! Now she is all upset because I told her it would take her 7 years to save up the robux for it. Like what the …..!?Why does a company even do that?????",N/A,N/A

This item is a limited, it was once obtainable many years ago for a cheap price for an extremely small amount of time.

Long Answer: It's a limited. Prices are set by what people will pay for it by other users. You can't equate the values of Robux in the limiteds market with real life values. Prices are inflated as there is no way to get value out of the market. This makes the USD value of all limiteds is $0. In general, people aren't buying in to the limiteds market with USD, they're using either income from games they can't devex, or income from trading up through the market itself.

A reckoning day for the limiteds market would be if Roblox ever allowed robux earned through trading to be Devexed. The market would completely collapse and the most expensive items (that are currently selling for millions) would be a couple of thousand robux at most.",imbq1tt,N/A

There are 2 types of limiteds:

1. Normal ""Limited"" items. You'll see a green icon with the word ""Limited"" in it at the corner of the item's picture. These are normal items that were eventually taken offsale, then Roblox decided to make limited. This type doesn't track the number of sales.

2. ""Limited U"" items. There's a yellow ""U"" symbol next to the green ""Limited"" symbol. These items are items that were sold in limited quantities at a fixed price. Afterwards, it becomes open to trade and sell by players. Each copy of the item has its own unique number (example: let's say you bought the 315th one so yours is 315).

More info:
Roblox players can buy, sell and trade only these types of items. It's sort of like a stock market with supply and demand. Except most expensive Limiteds are sold far cheaper than their asking price (search up Roblox Limiteds RAP value for more info). 

Also you can't legally convert the Robux made into real currency from trading (but the goal of being a trader is usually to be able to afford expensive top-tier limiteds anyways). Of course people who make their livings on the platform (Roblox developers, UGC modelers, clothing sellers, etc.) can also spend some of that Robux on expensive Limiteds too.",imfip5p,N/A

It’s a digital item that you can purchase with virtual currency, with a price controlled by players. but not every limited is unique, and limited Us are only unique by the serial number associated with it. limiteds are not recorded on the blockchain, and you do not own the rights to the hat you purchase. it’s no different than csgo skins or tf2 hats",imfutpt,ime25jn

My first game was Pitfall on a Commodore 64, and then an Atari after that.  However, we're also the generation that were mostly told that 'computer games are for kids', so a lot of us stopped playing games when we had to start adulting. Luckily for me, I never really got that memo, and I married a man who also played computer games, so we stuck with it.

comment,https://i.redd.it/f19c08ecw0q91.jpg,N/A,ImmortalBuns,2022-09-26,1664194190.0,1,"Prepare the filling

1. Mince 1 garlic clove, chop 1 green chili and ¼ of a medium onion (2 tablespoons fine chopped). Add all of these to a mixing bowl. Squeeze 1 tablespoon lemon juice & mix well. Lemon juice removes the pungent smell from garlic and onions. However if your mayo is too sour then skip the lemon juice.

2. Prepare the other veggies of your choice and add them to the bowl. I have used ¼ cup butter lettuce and ¼ cup chopped red capsicum here. You can also use shredded cabbage, carrots, boiled sweet corn etc. You can use about ½ cup in total.

3. Add ¼ teaspoon crushed black pepper, ¼ to ½ teaspoon red chili flakes, ¼ cup mayo (about 4 tablespoons) and ¼ teaspoon mustard powder. If you do not have mustard you can skip it, but I feel it adds lot of aroma to the filling. Mix all the ingredients. The filling is ready. Taste test and add more of chilli, pepper or mayo etc.

You may add any other sauce like red chilli sauce, mustard sauce or schezwan sauce.

Make Mayo Sandwich

4. Butter the bread slices and toast on a large griddle until golden and crisp. You can also skip toasting. You can also just butter the bread, then fill the sandwich and toast in sandwich maker.
5. Spread the mixture on a slice of bread.

spread the filling on toasted bread
6. Cover with another slice.

Slice mayo sandwich and serve!",ipylvlv,ipx97u8

I looked at the news the other day to find a news story about Pedophiles in ROBLOX.  It saddens me to realize that in the modern world we live in it is easily accessible for unsafe activity online. Roblox is the perfect place. 

Its younger player base as well as the fact that it is very is easy to grab kids attention. Whether it be by giving robux or offering in game items.  For example, in the ever so popular game collection of Pet Simulator, people just offer free pets through the trading option. They then add them and being talking. 

It is also very easy to fake your age, gender and name. For I have made and account which pretends me to be a 9 year old girl. I really hope roblox does something to stop these issues.

I have came up with a few ideas.  
\-Create an account limit to IP Address.  
\-Stop only thinking about monetary gain  
\-Remove the friends private chat feature all together  (If they wanted to chat they would do it else where)  
\-Add an age and gender verification system.   
\- Family settings and accounts ( Parent accounts look after and monitors friends and purchases...) Like the xbox feature.

Thank you

1. My family has one family computer. I have 4 siblings. What would be the limit? My mom had 11 siblings and they all had one family computer. If the limit is 10, then what? Someone (if roblox was around back then) wouldn’t get an account. So that’s a problem.

2. That’s capitalism. Asking a corporation to stop thinking of monetary gain is like telling someone to never think about eating. It’s not going to happen no matter how hard you try.

3. I use friends private chat to talk with multiple of my roblox friends outside of games. Just because you don’t use it doesn’t mean others don’t.

4. How would that work? How is a 9 year old going to verify their age? How would a 6 year old verify their gender? This most likely would not work and could lead to MAJOR lawsuits.

5. Roblox has those settings already for joining games. They can be set after a pin is entered, which the parents will usually have control of. This has already been implemented but the fact you’re posting that it should be shows it isn’t working.

I understand you’re trying to help and have ideas, I just don’t think it’s realistic to think this will happen anytime soon.",its7fzv,N/A

2. they have to pay the bills and so do the devs. There's something to be said about not taking 75% of player profit though

2.) They need money to make improvements to the platform 

3.) Dude that's a terrible idea just giving out more risk the child might reveal confidential stuff like address, phone number, age, etc.

4.) I agree a little on that but games that a child really want to play. For example he wanted to play Bedwars oh look it's 13+ ""I should make a 13+ old account just to play Bedwars"" I mean they need to get the passport just to make a account

If you don't have the time, then your kid shouldn't be playing until you do have the time. You could even work while your kid is playing as long as you can see their screen at any point of time. This would prevent many things as young kids tend to fail at hiding things they shouldn't be doing. This also prevents misusage of technology. Cooperations won't put many prevention in place because how costly and time consuming it is. Although cooperations should do their jobs, it's also a parent's responsibility to watch their children in such a big and surveillanced world.",ittrpuh,N/A

Reply to point 1) The IP address was an idea which many other games use, Fortnite [Krunker.io](https://Krunker.io) and many more. If it were under my control then you would be able to apply for exemption and then more accounts could be made. 

2) Thats the problem with the modern world we live in- Most people put themselves before others. (The whole idea of Capitalism in my opinion).

3) I understand that but that is where the family settings would be able to verify friends and then chat. The whole problem is people adding randoms, talking, then talking elsewhere.

4) Your right, kids should be kids, they shouldn't worry about genders in the first place. Age though would be quite easy, send a picture and you would be able to tell the difference between and 11 year old and a 50 year old.

5) It should be a default setting and could be improved majorly.

Dynamic IP addresses are standard but not universal, you might not have the feature.

>Discord has a tiny bit better age restriction- My brothers account got removed the other day for age. Discord removes sign up on the certain browser as soon as you put in an age under 13.

You have to atleast turn your modem off for a day. To have a unlikely chance of getting a new Ip address. Most people wont go without home internet for a day just for a small chance.

That's... completely false. Dynamic IPs are assigned when your modem connects to the ISP(and on the local area network when you connect your device to the router but that doesn't impact IP bans). You'll need to wait 5 minutes, if that.

>Kids are like that.

>But everything catches up with you. It only takes one wrong message for you to be reported.

Or.

A child, like I did, recognizes that less personal information on the internet is better, and remains anonymous.

Alternatively, they do get slapped with a ban from discord or whatever... and then they just make a new account and lie about their age again.

It's convenient fiction to believe that these measures stop kids that want it.",itsgegw,itscx4e

I have two sons who I let play Roblox occasionally.  They are 10, and 7, and probably a little too trusting of friends.

Last night both of my kids were locked out of their accounts when I let them play before bed.  It would appear that one of their IRL friends was hacked, or scammed out of his account password, and then contacted my sons who trusted this person, and gave out their passwords.

We have since had a discussion about putting information out over the internet and sharing passwords, but their accounts are still in control of whoever this other person is.

I dont have much proof of their account, but I do know their in game names, and I have bought them in game currency before, and we also know the last password, so if anyone has any ideas, I would really really appreciate the help.  They are freaking out a little.",N/A,N/A

In regards to your question, [I recommend contacting the roblox customer service](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313390-My-Account-was-Hacked-What-do-I-do-) if you are unable to recover via email. It's important to note though that ~~if~~ the customer service representative working with you approves your sons' accounts for a restoration (such as if items/robux were taken out of the accounts), they will only do so once for an account; this means that if either of your sons' accounts are compromised in the future, regardless of losing a significant amount more or less of items/robux, they will be ineligible for an item/robux restoration (they will however be eligible for assistance in retrieving a compromised account). Likewise, customer support has a 14-day limit on item/currency restorations. Although the link doesn't explicitly mention this, users on this subreddit have reported past successes in recovering accounts if they made purchases on them - with this in mind, I recommend keeping your payment information on standby but not providing anything unless asked. I hope that this helps! As a final note, this subreddit is community moderated and is not affiliated with roblox - I am not a roblox employee and all the information that I provided is based solely on information that I have read over the years; my comment regarding payment information may or may not be applicable today however, the link I provided comes directly from roblox and *should* be correct.

Prequalifiaction: All I know about Roblox is what I've found via google since my 7 y/o daughter finally browbeat me into installing Roblox onto her tablet.  She started playing this, and we enabled the <13 parental controls, and go in and clear out her friends list and repeat to her daily ""you're too young to make friends on the internet.""

Thing is, I noticed the other day she was playing Meeps (test) which from what I can gather is a test version of the more popular MeepCity game?   Anyways, in this game, she has a completely separate friends list, and the parental restrictions on chatting are completely circumvented as the app has it's own chat system.

Am I crazy, or is this a blatant glaring hole in the parental controls philosophy?  

Also, it looks like the parental controls don't allow her to play MeepCity, but somehow the test version is okay? 

Can someone explain to me what I might be missing?  I don't mind her running around in silence in the game, but I'm just not ready for her to socialize with strangers online quite yet.",N/A,N/A

There are two currencies used in ROBLOX; Tix and Robux, which are both exchangeable at around a 1:18 (robux:tix) rate. You get 10 free tix every day you log in, and Robux is the payed currency. With Robux you can purchase a lot of cosmetics, whereas with tix your choices are more limited and you have to save for longer. There are a few games where you must pay Robux to gain access, but most are free-to-play.

To conclude, I believe your son can enjoy ROBLOX without the need to spend any money on it.

EDIT: A recent blog post announces the removal of tix, now the game will only utilize Robux as a currency. This shouldn't mean much for a player who didn't intend to spend money, they might even benefit as free cosmetic items will be released.",d0ycfe2,N/A

Yes, there is some levels that you have to pay. But that is in-game currency. If you can't afford to play thoses levels, there is alot of free levels that can be actually pretty cool. 

> How is the pay structure for this game is it just for cosmetic items or do you need to pay for the levels etc?

You pay for cosmetic items and also gears (which kinda are used more for cosmetic purposes, because many games doesn't allow gears), but they shouldn't affect gameplay that much. You also can pay for levels, but most of them (around 80%), are free to play. Another thing that costs money (in-game currency at least), are gamepasses. Some might give you advatange in the game, while others are also cosmetic.

So in short, there are games that you have to pay to play, but there is ALOT of cool games that are free as well. The currency in gam can be used for alot of things: buying levels, cosmetic (hats, pants, shirts), gears and also gamepasses.",d0ybnkr,N/A

Other than that, email ROBLOX as the others have said. 

Tell your daughter that she should never give her account details out, to anyone. ROBLOX specifies that themselves.

You can also add a phone number now, I recommend doing that when ROBLOX has helped you remove the pin.

Hope you get the account secured!",dsm8f29,N/A

4. Basically just non stop reset my password (I had my email on my account, and the hacker kept resetting my password)

Hi guys, I need some help. My nephew loves Roblox but he is constantly getting griefed when he plays, and acts out his frustrations on various household objects. I do not really understand how this game works but I am pretty sure their should be some friendly areas to play where he could opt in or out of PvP, or play with children his own age to avoid these violent outbursts.

Roblox isn't exactly a game on it's own. If you're familiar with Steam, it's kind of like that, except every game on the site is made with Roblox's game engine. So rather than 'servers' - they're full blown games.

Your best suggestion is to try and introduce him to Roblox Studio. While it's a little overkill giving a 7 year old a game engine, it's also one of the best places to build since nobody can destroy your work, and you can also bring in friends with the Team Create feature. Heck, you might even get him interested in wanting to make his own games and become a programmer(I know a lot of young kids who learned programming early on from Roblox).

If that doesn't work, you can always try looking for games on Roblox specified around building like Sandbox. 

Other than that, if you have any questions feel free to ask.",e8l7wsb,N/A

To answer your question, I reccomend [the future](https://www.roblox.com/games/725112818/the-future). It's a very shallow game, but hopefully the devs add more stuff.

Been playing Mr fast food and there are so many mysteries.  

Me and my friends have been trying to solve it.   

When the game was just posted, The main player was the son/daughter of this Mr Fast Food Restaurant, And the player was looking into his/her dad secrets. At the end of the game The player makes it to the attic and find this photo of this girl.   

In the next update you play as one of the missing people.  It starts off where you're going to Mr fast food to get a burger but things get dark fast when Mr food lock you in prison.   

Also at the beginning of the game you can find Mr Fast Food under the ball pit (could this be the real mr fast?) also you can find someone lock in jail the person lock in jail look like the person from the missing person poster.   

So who took over this big fast food Restaurant? if the real owner is under the ball pit and at the end of the game there was this giant machine that look like it was turning people.

What do you guys think?

My only knowledge of the game is spending time with her while she plays, so I know I'm pretty limited on it, but I kind of get it. I'm a tech guy and have some IT certs, so I can set stuff up for her, I just don't know if I can or what I can do. Do any of you have any advice to something a little more special than just some Robucks? I guess if there was one thing you wish your parents could do for you for the game, what would it be? I should be able to figure any technical stuff, I just need to be pointed in the right direction. Thanks guys, and I know this is pretty open, but like I said, I'm not sure where to start. Thanks for you time, have a great day.

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm not looking to break the TOS of the game or do anything to get her account banned. ",N/A,N/A

( IF SHE HAS A PC! )

Oh if you want to do something special, you can teach her on how to make a game using Roblox studio: http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=AllTutorials 

This site is amazing! It will teach you how to make maps and you and your daughter can learn together! 

I would scroll down until you see ""Building Series"" then go on from there. ( If you need help, just say so )

It would be really helpful for your daughter in the future as Roblox teaches modeling, coding ( Roblox uses LUA ), and using a workspace at a young age. 


***Option 2***

If you want to do something more, I would look into getting her set up and recording videos for Roblox on her computer then uploading to Youtube. That can also teach her some life skills. 

If you want to get started, I would look at 
OBS: https://obsproject.com/ ( Screen Recorder )

Audacity: http://www.audacityteam.org/ ( Voice Recorder )

GIMP: https://www.gimp.org/ ( Photo Editor )

Sony Vegas ( Education isn't cheap ;) ): http://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/ ( Video Editor )

( Although I said Sony Vegas, if you can find a cheaper video editor, I would look into that also )


***Option 3***

Getting her BC, with BC she has the ability to make Clothes and sell them for a profit. ( She can earn Robux )

Make groups for her friends to join and others. 

The ability to make money from her creations on Roblox, following the Developer Exchange of course: https://www.roblox.com/develop/developer-exchange",dr4ef09,N/A

By the way, if you get Builders Club (especially a plain normal monthly BC), utilize it properly. It costs around 5.99, and offers accessibility to great features such as advertising, group owning, clothing making which greatly helps for developing purposes. 

I am saying this from personal experience. It only gives 15 robux everyday, (800 total) so a kid can't get super rich enough to buy limited edition items, but you can increase your earned robux if you sell some clothing and gamepasses. 

Many kids wish for Turbo or Outrageous Builders Club on Christmas or their birthdays because it gives the greatest amounts of Robux so that they can buy, trade, and sell limited items. A normal Builders club would be pointless for these kids unless they make profit from sales. I personally prefer a normal myself because I love developing, and make clothing. Depends on the kid. 

But yeah, try what works for her. :) This website will also allow a kid to tap into their artsy, and STEM side. And there are so many cool things on YouTube. I've even seen parents stream with their kids, and kids themselves storytelling, so you can try that.",drk7uci,N/A

However, many games offer a VIP server option that you can buy with Robux to play with only friends in that specific game. 
I think the best gift you could give would be a Builder's Club membership. Depending on the tier you buy, you get a set amount of Robux per day (which could help her not blow it all at once), along with a host of other benefits.",dr4y132,N/A

Then you can speak to your daughter about what type of BC she wants. ",dr4em0h,dr4d4v5

If all she's interested in is playing with her friends, Roblox will last and be enjoyable for her for a long time. The changes won't affect her. (Most recent change was the removal of the forums, which were an extremely toxic and unhealthy environment.)
  
That being said, [here's](https://www.roblox.com/premium/membership?ctx=preroll) the official page dedicated to Builders Club (BC). It'll describe everything you need to know. Some useful features for her are:

* Daily Robux (15 for BC/35 for Turbo BC/60 for Outrageous BC)
* She can create and join more than 5 groups.
* She gets a few free items first time that she can keep forever.
* While the account has any form of BC, she gets bonus Robux when buying it directly.
* BC generates more Robux overtime than just buying it directly.
  
For example, if you buy her any Builders Club (5.95 for 1 month is the cheapest), you will get 450 Robux instead of just 400 Robux if you buy the 4.95 option right after purchasing BC. 
  
BC also has many other features she may be interested in if she ever wants to make her own games in the future.
  
If you were to buy her anything, I'd say 1-2 months of Outragous Builders Club is best bet. Each month costs 19.95. The biggest benefit is that she receives 60 robux daily (1,860 Robux a month/31 days, which is better than directly buying 20 dollars of Robux, which will only get her 1,200 Robux.)
  
Figuring out the best option for you is determined by your budget (And a bit of math), but general rule of thumb, if you buy any Robux, buy BC first. 

-----

Also, for renting servers. Some games (Not all) have a private server option, which allows you to create invite-only instances of a game. It costs Robux, and the price is determined by game. Renting a private server will last for a month, then needs to be renewed. Private servers are also per-game. 
  
I highly suggest against using robux on private servers, though. She can make parties for free with chat features, which will make her join servers that are big enough to host all her friends. (For example, if she has 2 friends in her party and a game has 9 player slots open, she will always join servers with 6 players or less)

I've been on the platform for 11+ years now and even a decade ago the same arguments were being made when the top games only had 100 players. The front page cycles pretty well on a yearly basis.

Terrible Roblox Support Rant:

I just wanted to warn others in case they spend money on the game..

My daughter's account was locked/deleted due to what roblox said was a ""contested charge.""

I have never contested a charge, nor can I find any evidence of a charge being contested.  The only thing I can find is that apple billing may have had an issue - which I resolved. After it was resolved, I was instantly charged $16.12 by roblox - which I suspect is what locked the account. Roblox refuses to provide support, will not provide ANY details(to help me determine what they're seeing), and does not seem to care. I have tried for over two months to get this resolved with no luck.  This is an account I've spent easily hundreds on over the years.

So... be careful spending your time and money with a company that doesn't care.",N/A,N/A

This is all speculation but exploiters know that the chargeback system causes account termination no questions asked. Hopefully roblox can find a way to mitigate this so it doesn’t happen to others in the future.

Roblox ( or any company ) is charged by their bank or payment processor anytime a chargeback occurs ( sometimes over $25 in fees for each chargeback, which add up ) so it’s industry standard any company will terminate your account after a chargeback.",ix01mrj,N/A

Click on my profile and check out my other posts. I got my daughter an Invader Zim cake from the same bakery. They do a nice job, but TBH my son’s cake looked rushed and sloppy compared to my daughter’s. Furthermore, I could make my kids cake, but I always get so caught up in the custom decorations. I normally have no time to bake and design a cake. Lol

Sorry for asking a question that's probably been asked a million times. I played roblox about a decade ago and my nephew now plays it. I signed us both up for Builders club so I can give him my coins and items (which are worth I guess around a student loans payment lol...) but when I try to give it to him, it seems like there's nothing in his inventory that I can trade for to make it go through, all it says under his inventory is ""No Items To Display"".

So is there an electronic card option that would work here? The ones I've seen online seem to be only for a few markets and probably can't be redeemed here, from what I understand.

Or could he log into his account and we use my paypal to buy him some robux?

No, the forums ended up being too toxic and too hard for Roblox to maintain, so they have been taken down. You don't honestly need them anyways, unless you're trying to join ""war clans"" (a different side of Roblox where huge groups get together and battle at specific times).
>Is there a risk of predators on the platform?

I can safely say ""no"" here. There's a VERY strict filter in place where you can't even say numbers half the time (intentionally), and anything that looks like personal information is filtered as well.

The biggest risk here is ""online dating"", which itself is questionable and often punished anyway. Monitor which games your child plays and you'll be fine.

> ... the game does not have inappropriate voice chat.

The game does not have voice chat at all, unless you play on the Xbox. Voice chat is mandatory there on all multiplayer games (""thanks"" Microsoft!). If you hear voices on a platform that isn't Xbox, it's a sound sample someone played or set off.",dr89ny3,N/A

I would like to point out, that the media was kind of exaggerating the thing about predators being on Roblox. Roblox is at least safer than many, if not most online games. The chat filter has grown to become very smart- it can detect the order of words and censors them, so that it will know if one is asking for an address. Also, when your son gets a little older, this game can teach him coding skills and building through Roblox Studio. So that's one perk you have to keep in mind.",drk6jko,N/A

Among other things, it points you to their Parental Controls which can help limit what actions your child can take, such as only playing on games that have strict filtering in place, or preventing in-game purchases of Robux using real-life money (*they can still be earned if your child does something that earns Robux, such as making a t-shirt sale or gamepass sale. Doing that requires a PC, however.*)

I would also consider giving your child a crash course in Internet safety, just in case something happens that gets through the filter. You can find lots of free Internet safety courses on, well, the internet, some of them child-oriented.",dr8a8n9,dr8a3db

Games I would suggest: Camping chapter 1, 2 and 3(story games), scp roleplay(roleplay game), generic roleplay gaem.(roleplay game, its actually funny and entertaining but would not be good if your kids want to play a serious roleplay game), Tower Defense Simulator(tower defense game), any existing tower defense game you can see when searching tower defense(Tower Battles if you want to team up with your children and compete against other players, but you will 99% lose when starting to play the game since the game is heavily based on the amount of time you played the game, otherwise just stick with Tower Defense Simulator), Facade(puzzle game), Find the Button(puzzle game)

Always play the games your children like(try different types of games with your children to know what they like), and avoid serious First Person Shooters(just some sort of gunfight games) unless your children really like those kinds of games since roblox avatar has a huge head and your children will most likely get 1 shot and gets angry. FPS games to avoid: Arsenal(0 co-experience), Counter Blox(hard), Phantom Forces(hard). Some FPS games are still fine though, most of the FPS games that doesn't have realistic graphics indicate that the game is pretty chill and toxicity-free. Avoid games with long games and is not 100% win(or at least high chance), since it would be really tiring and sad when losing.

* Survival 303 by Davidii, the learning curve might be a bit hard, but it's all about teamwork and creativity. The main basis of the game is creating a whole city out of raw materials, it's still quite a good game, there's a discontinued version that's a bit broken, but still working known as Survival 404. Personally, I prefer 404 over 303 as it's more nostalgic. 

* Natural Disaster Survival, by StickMasterLuke. It's quite a good game! The premise of it is simple to grasp and I've played it a lot, racking up to around 500 survivals. When I don't have weekend plans, it's usually what I play. Helped me a lot through a rough time in my life as it took my minds off things. 

* Darkness 2, by Loleris. While the game might be a bit PG, kids still enjoy it and it's a good thrill. The game is basically an upgraded version of hide and seek where It has a scythe and the people hiding have a gun.

i develop small games on roblox that get a handful of visits, and while I do my own coding and building i insert small free models here and there to speed up the process so I'll share what you can do to remove any viruses from the freemodels

the first step is to determine if it is a simple build (like the buildings in the game) or if it is something technical, like the piggy using a baseball bat which requires a script to work

if it is a normal building it should be really easy to remove viruses, normally all you have to do is select the small drop-down menu next to the model (icon looks like 2 red squares and a green one somewhere in the middle, click it to make sure you have the right one and it will highlight it in the viewer on the left), and delete anything labeled ""localscript"" or ""script""

if it is something technical like piggy this will most likely be difficult if you don't have a background with lua coding but I'll do my best to explain it, using the same setup as before where you need to find the right model and click the drop-down menu, look through any files inside of that model and double click anything named ""script"" or ""localscript"", this will open it, now I'm gonna break this into subcategories (particles, non particles)
to determine which is which, should it have particles? for example, a cheeseburger shouldn't have flames coming out of it but a gun would have muzzle flash

if it is particles, you are good for now

if it is non particles but it has particles, it would likely be a good play to delete them, and normally it is made using an instance.new(), so press Ctrl+F and type in instance.new and try to find something that sounds like a particle, common names would be fire, smoke, and sparkles. if it is inside a ""function"", (looks like this:

function lagbomb()
    Instance.new(""Fire"")
end
) then you'll want to highlight anything that says the variable, which in our case is lagbomb, the things you want to highlight look like ""lagbomb():"" and delete all but one

if it is non particles and has no particles visible it would still be best to do the above just in case the particles are hidden

Looking at your plugins tab does not necessarily show all of yours plugins. A plugin does not need to display a toolbar for it to be run.

If the game you are developing on has Team Create, make sure your colleagues do not have malicious plugins themselves. If not, make sure to check all your plugins and test their veracity.",ipoip54,N/A

I already sent a ticket to roblox support but its been 3 days now without response. My daughter is 6 years old and have a luekemia. She was devastated when she learn that she cannot access her account anymore. Roblox is the only way that make her happy during her chemotherapy treatment. 

I made her a new account but she's not really that happy and misses her account. I spent a lot of robux on that account so she can buy anything she likes. 

Is there a faster way for the support to respond? If there's a support person here her username is EugenioGabby

What I suggest you do is contact them on the Roblox website, you should get an email giving you articles based on what you put your problem as. Obviously you have looked at them and they don’t help, so reply to that automatic email they sent and you should get a response quicker, than actually emailing info.roblox.

Tbh I only got back my main because I have my account logged in on so many devices and I can’t really say Roblox Support i unhelpful or something because my situation was very sketchy tbf, but I did agree to give proof but they still said they can’t verify, blah, blah, blah. So I can’t really speak for people who got their accounts hacked and didn’t get it back because mine is just that I enabled two step verification, to be safer and since I made my account years ago m, I must have had a different email (that i don’t remember), so it was sending to one of my emails but i dont know what that email is and even if I did, I wouldn’t remember the password for the email lol. So I was basically trying to bypass the whole point of 2 step verification, so yh Mega shady but I wouldn’t be this persistent if I was trying to hack an account.

But anyways I got it back due to my account already logged in on my other laptop, so lucky me but yh do what I said in the beginning and see where it goes from there",fv6mh8o,N/A

After he asked what nfr legendaries my sis had he told her he will hack her account and mine though she left in time before he could follow her or try to friend her or remember her user id. She told me i put some privacy settings and i made another account to transfer her legendaries and helped her but before she joined there was a message this accound is not authorised. It was yesterday at 11:30pm today everything is fine but My sister felt a bad feeling since he was named in chinese and spoke our language certainly the account was hacked that he was using and hacking is increased in lockdown as people can sell the hacked because everybody is facing a financial crisis.,fv7smha,N/A

The obstacles are really creative but predictable, making it easy and a game for people who have had a bad day, the GUI was really good with the deaths screen, and the start screen was pretty basic but it s the job well

The obstacles are randomised which are nice, but some of them dont work too well or work too well, the bridge sometimes wont work (for the part where it goes down) due to roblox's climbing physics, so u might want to do is make the bridge a bit flatter and a climb up. The mines are too close together and im unsure if the speed increases, but if it does then it will start being impossible.

Maybe randomise the name on the tombstone and make the tombstone smaller, its more QOL changes than practicaliy, but that would be cool.

Definitely a good game, i hope it gets more attention  because it looks rly well designed and definitely a game with youtube video potential",h64knau,N/A

My daughter (7) just asked to purchase $5 in Robux.

I'm pretty against the Pay to win models most mobile games use as I deem them to be predatory and borderline gambling in some games.

So I have a couple questions for this community...
Is roblox pay to win or will robux be more used for cosmetic purchases?

Do they run % deals on robux? Like get an extra 20% in robux if you buy this deal and things like that. Or holiday deals.

And any other useful information for a dad who knows little about this game is appreciated too!

Alright, for my part.

I wouldn't deem roblox predatory in ***a lot of cases.*** The thing is, Roblox is notorious for Online Daters, or OD's.

Roblox has a safe chat system, where you can't say for example, ""how old are you?"" or ""what's your name?""  
""where do you live?"" or swear words.

Bypasses do exist, like re\^tard and all that stuff.

Robux is used for   
A. Catalog/Avatar, customize your avatar.

B. To play games. Example: To play Bloxburg you need 25 Robux.

C. Gamepasses/powerups or In-Game Items, (a gun, teddy bear...)

D. To buy money in games. What I mean by this is you can use Robux to buy currency in games. if you wanna get money in-game quickly.

As for the Gambling part, such as loot boxes in games to give you ie. a skin for a gun, usually, it's not for  Robux, or there is only one loot box/crate for Robux. (arsenal example, [http://prntscr.com/ttw0et](http://prntscr.com/ttw0et) )

For the deal part:  
I've been playing since 2016, And never have I saw a deal for Robux, as far as I **remember.** The closest thing to a deal for Robux is to get premium, which will give you **more** Robux then without premium.   
(**premium is 5$/month. Gives you 450 Robux/month, more Robux if you wanna buy it, premium access in games, If you have premium, in some games, you can buy certain things you couldn't without premium, I don't know a game that does this, maybe jailbreak. I don't play lot of games.** )

Pay to win part:  
Pay to win is despised in literally every branch of gaming. Gaming is about skill, not how much money will you spend.

 Some games **do** have pay to win stuff, but this is so rare because of hate, that they barely exist. **But.** Roblox pulled off a P2W during the last event (an event is where you do things to get things, like an egg hunt. not the best explanation, but you have Wikipedia.)  Roblox is a free game, for kids, as wiki said, a lot of users are <16.

Other than that, Roblox is safe if you know somewhat what are you doing. 

Roblox is safe like 99%. There are bypasses, but in all honesty, child predators don't exist at this point in Roblox. ODers are also not a huge problem. Though, there is a conspiracy that Roblox is supporting oder's because they usually dress up in clothes for Robux, Thus giving Roblox **money.** I recommend this channel to learn more about OD'ing.

You \*could\* develop a pay2win game, but roblox doesn't like that. Your game won't reach the front page and it won't get recognition from roblox in any way. I'm 99% sure most of the front page games focus on the socializing aspect of a game. Some games on there don't even have any gamepasses or are very cheap or purely cosmetic.

&#x200B;

Roblox rewards games who maximize playtime and encourage socializing. Yes, there are premium-only cosmetics on the roblox catalog and features in some games but it is usually not game-breaking or often cosmetics.

Whatever the big thing is will always get attacked in whatever it's potential weak spot is or could be.

With Roblox being an online game for children, you bet controversial articles about safety will pop up. Minecraft survived it no problem, and that game is centered around building your own objects. That is a tough thing to moderate.

I feel like Roblox has an even better chance of surviving this, since most players play only the games that are already popular. Plus they have such a strict chat filter, that works most of the time.",djlckky,djkuy09

Roblox knows that they can't directly moderate voice chat, and so do, well, voice chatters. The censor may be easy to bypass but it does work to an extent.

13 is generous considering the things I've heard.

At the end of the day, Roblox is a magical free nanny parents leave their kids with to get them to shut up. That means they have, at best, a surface level understanding of what Roblox can and cannot do as far as moderation goes, without losing any capacity to create ruinous social media uproars. 

It's one thing to see someone messily bypass the filter as a parent, it's another for mommy to hear someone say the n word on little Jimmy's block game before they start sexually moaning. As far as the parent is concerned, Roblox did something about the former. They didn't stop the latter at all.

Forgive me if I don't get alll the terminology correct here as I don't play the game.

My 11 year old daughter has been playing  roblox for quite a while and from what I can tell has built herself up a decent account. Recently someone scammed her somehow by stealing some sort of legendary rideable flyable neon dragon and some various other animals she had collected . She was devastated. We talked about password safety and scammers. Today she came Out bawling saying someone scammed her during something called a trust trade?

This person promised her a bunch of stuff for her rideable dragon but from what I gather, the person took the dragon and left the server.

Is there anything I can do to help her get this stuff back? I emailed roblox a while back about the first incident and they couldn't garuntee her stuff being reinstated and it doesn't look like its going to be.

Sorry if none of this makes sense. It doesn't make much sense to me either am I'm trying my best to help her out.  Thanks!",N/A,N/A

I'm sorry for you're daughter and her lost things. I assume that the game is the certain: Adopt Me! game? I don't think there is anyway to get her stuff back but some tips for you're daughter:

Never Trust anyone that you don't know in real life.

Don't do trust trades! 99% of the time it's a scam.

Don't give out a password to someone when they guarantee free stuff.

Don't buy other perks from other games telling they'll guarantee you that item in another game.

Trade stuff that are the same value.

Whenever trading, write down the user's name so if they leave, you can report them to the owner of the game or Roblox Support.

I tried to help you. I hope you appreciate!

The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your ‘left’? Or the one on your ‘right’? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is ‘correct’ too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute ‘society’ with the ‘Universe’. The correct answer is that ‘It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.’ …Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there’s no choice but for others to also take the ‘right’ napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is ‘society’… Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of ‘right or left?’! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who ‘takes the napkin first’ must be someone who is respected by all. It’s not that anyone can fulfill this role… Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the ‘losers’. In the case of this table, the ‘eldest’ or the ‘Master of the party’ will take the napkin first… Because everyone ‘respects’ those individuals.",is82e9q,N/A

He figured it out all by himself and edited and uploaded his first video. He was freaking out this morning because he now has 4 subscribers. If anyone wants to blow a 9yo’s mind, give him a thumbs up and a sub and you’ll make his day/week/year.

Content is a mix of automated and manually moderated. Automation is applied to the things that \*can\* be automated, such as text. If you browse this subreddit for a while you may see lots of complaints about the filter being imperfect, which is expected. You can always turn text chat off completely.

Other uploaded content such as images, music, or things of that nature are manually moderated. Roblox may be a big company, but image recognition software is not perfect, so a human looks at every image, song, video, clothing, and more that are added to the site. I remember when they first added videos, that I had to sometimes sit there and watch all these 30 second videos back to back to back just to approve them. It was boring and awful.

The one major thing that is NOT looked at by a human are the games. They really can't prevent users from taking bricks and using them to spell out swears, or do other things like that. This is where they rely on user reports.

The main take away is that humans do most of this moderation, so things will always slip through. It catches 99% of bad content, but when a million items are uploaded each day, that means that 10,000 bad items make it through.",h75txy2,N/A

they check messages for key words, and respond accordingly. mostly with a gross overreaction, thanks to some mild incompetence and people 1984-ing words (ie. changing the definition of a word to alter the potential meaning of a sentence, for example gay could be a sexual orientation or a generic word for something being bad)

But something I will say is that there is a botting problem on roblox which people send bots to groups and games which claims that you can get free robux if you go on a certain website which is not true and a scam. But now a days it's not even a problem and game developers and groups found ways to prevent bots from spamming in games and groups on roblox.

It honestly takes too long without any external help (auto clicker), even in the **DEATH RING** you gain only a tad more. Respawn is basically ""pay up"" or wait like an extra 20 seconds to respawn. Nothing on the outside except *King Of The Hill* which in my opinion has no point, it should increase XP gain to make it so people would actually go there, everyone is in the safe zone or the **DEATH RING.** Why does money exist, for skins only, not much incentive to actually gain them, as they only look cool, and don't help gameplay-wise. It's a cool game for a 12-year-old, just that it lacks a lot of gameplay elements which can make it much better.  


Also want to point out, there's an entire row of game passes, most of them look to pay to win. Just had a skim of it, and found 2X health, which breaks the fairness of the game, GOD TIER, completely ruins the game, instakill??? Someone could buy that and rise through the leaderboard like a god, at least he did price it fairly, more abilities and strength = bigger price. For a free to play like me (no I do have Robux, but I generally never pay to get stuff unless it donations), these spoil the game, I shouldn't say you should remove them more likely to just increase the price or nerf the down a little. Cause I know a couple of people who would be willing to pay 41,000 to just have God Tier in a game. No wonder it has 100 dislikes.  


Had a small explore of the surrounding area, and the only thing I found was a freaking Booster shop with no other than game passes, I would understand if it was purchasable by coins, it would make sense, but game passes it just looks like its there to fill blank spaces. Like I said there's no point in exploring, all you need is an auto clicker and a lot of Robux. It's lovely outside scenery, but there's no point exploring unless there's something to do. Like conquerable areas, castles and maybe other shops. This game is just a clicker simulator but with swords plastered to do, I got bored after reaching 2nd Level, looked at how many clicks I needed to do and instantly quit.   


My suggestions list: More skins, add decoration around the shop circles (it looks very odd the booster circle), add some conquerable areas and castles, add stuff to make the area around it much more enjoyable, passive XP gain, pets (yes the theme fits, unlike Battery Simulator, add dragon or Hoglin pets), different dimensions (if you're going for medieval fantasy, then Dimensions suit it, something like a witch's village or the dangerous depths of hell, each has different skins and XP gains), quests (fits the theme), more coin usage (more things to buy, the just skins), potions, shields, transport (only add if your gonna expand the outside)  


It's a good game, I don't mean to sound harsh, also these are just my opinions, I'm too a young developer and would also hate to see someone hating my game, but you should listen to criticism as it can expand your game into something that no other game could possibly think so. I just to want to say something, ""Always keep in mind all Roblox members"", free to plays, guys willing to spend Robux, explorers, adventures, you have to give everyone something even if it's small, it can have a big big big impact.

I have 6 year old twin boys who love roblox. I'm a gamer too, so I'm wondering what Roblox games you all would recommend I play with my sons? I've tried a few but many are too simple and repetitive for me to enjoy for long. Some of my favorite games are Path of Exile, Borderlands, Sea of Thieves, DoTA, Slime Rancher, to name a few.  


I remember playing a game with them once where you had to build a ship out of random parts and try to survive some tough rapids, and that was fun. Maybe there are some other good games in that vein?

This is extremely important. Monitor who your child is playing with, talking to, and game they are playing. Roblox may seem like a fairly kid friendly game, but not all the time. As long as they are safe, they should be okay. Setting your child's age above 13 will disable privacy mode, which means everything (except adult swear words) is uncensored and social media on Roblox is enabled. Here are some games I recommend and do not recommend:

Adopt Me is a game about adopting a child or a pet an taking care of them by pampering them. This game is okay for a small child, but it is based around chatting with other people with being able to trade for pets and roleplaying. Something to keep an eye out for is scammer who scam them to take their in-game currency and rare pets. Other than that, Adopt Me should be safe. Your second twin would like this game.

Piggy is a puzzle-horror game where the player must escape Peppa the serial killer (based off the show Peppa Pig) and escape the building while solving puzzles. A little bit of scary material. Nothing bad, really.
Arsenal is an FPS very similar to Fortnite, except everytime you kill someone, you get another gun. The first person to get to 29 kills wins. The only thing I would take note of is toxicity and people blasting inappropriate music.

Simulators are completely fine.

Something to keep an eye out for is scammer who scam them to take their in-game currency and rare pets. Other than that, Adopt Me should be safe. Your second twin would like this game.

I am not a fan of adopt me, I have nothing angst the creators but the game is just not appealing to males over the age of 13.",g4rlw7p,g4mkmal

Tldr: found password for account from 2009 every old game I played is broken. When did this happen. Why.

Hello everyone!
This past week I was helping my parents move and they were tossing some old furniture. One piece was a huge part of my childhood, the computer desk. The inside drawer was full of my terrible handwriting and one thing written was my old Roblox password back from like 2009-2014. I was really bored and decided to hop on and see if I had any friends online or to see my old games I used to play (I only had one friend online).

After trying to play some of the older games that had the OG wand tool and explosion hammer and the stanper tool, I noticed a lot of them just didn't work anymore. The explosion hammer worked but then the paint bucket wouldn't or the stamp tool didn't work.

Has anyone else experienced this? Was it always like this and nostalgia is fogging my brain? Is there anyway to get these to work again? Half of the games I used to play are broken or disconnected. When did this happen?",N/A,N/A

I’m a 19 year old female. I’ve been playing roblox since I was 13. I’m a quiet player, I don’t get involved in drama, I just watch and find it amusing because I used to be like that but I still enjoy the games. I’m still considered a “teen” in some respects but I am also aware I am a legal adult. Whenever a kid comes up to me and does something sus or says something sus, I just joke it off with “haha save that for other minors kid”. But then I get slammed with “imagine being an adult on roblox” “why are you on a KIDS game?” 

Just because it’s aimed to be safe for younger kids doesn’t say anywhere that adults are even discouraged from playing. It doesn’t really bother me when kids say this, because it’s obviously ignorant. But it happens so often I’m curious why people actually think we shouldn’t play?",N/A,N/A

My view of roblox has changed over the years yet i'm still as big a fan as ever. For some reason i keep on finding new things on the platform to enjoy when the stuff i used to play no longer has any appeal, it's almost like an infinite cycle...

When it comes to dealing with children, i gotta admit i hate kids, their stupid actions, and MY stupid actions when i was their age, it's a hatred fueled by regrets. In the scenario where a kid attempts to troll me, i instintively point out the facts and disprove whatever they throw my way, regardless if they are ignorant of it or not. Usually, this only happens when it's between me and only 1 other person, or if in groups, my sude will always have equal or more people on it. If i'm in a scenario with multiple trolls however, two things can happen. 1: If i'm just a normal player, i'll dip immediately, the rule of thumb is to never fight against a larger group. 2: If i am a GM, and the game disallows trolling, it's up to the punishment guidelines of said game.",hoi8sxo,N/A

My guess as to why this happens is that they're A. Just trying to troll you, or B. a bit dum dum. I can't make any more \*reasonable\* predictions beyond that, because I simply cannot relate.

However, I accept that there are adults in this platform, though they seem few and far between. In fact, I may say that being with adults is much nicer, as it might even be a great learning experience.

A decade ago, I was a kid who discovered Roblox and got attached to the game

I still remember spending hours playing simple games like Obbies, run from the mummy, or dead space

I only came back to Roblox a couple of years ago because I made the decision to embrace it.

Roblox is meant to be an all ages game, and adults like us just aren't seen around too often

If it helps, Roblox is starting to address the adult audience and are planning to make moves for it

I'm now 15 years old, and yeah, litterally younger than you are, but I don't hate adults that play Roblox. Those their accounts, their times, their blah blah... and their choices, we can't judge them.

Sometimes kids loves to play with adults, whom they consider as "" big bro or big sis"" and the kids are ""smol bro, smol sis"". That make them feel like they are playing with a real family, but in game.

For example: me and some of my friends play with a guy at the age of 18, which being considered as adult. But we enjoy playing with him and end up good with him.",hoiy4bl,N/A

I started playing with my son during the pandemic to keep an eye on my then 5 year old. I connected with other adults around my age, younger and even older who also play regularly. We are the ones spending the most on it probably lol

I got hooked on world zero and now they have guilds. So I joined one and they have a discord so I use it to keep updated but do not talk to anyone at all. I also added on my profile on both discord and roblox that I’m an adult. I often get asked why I would play roblox even by 18/19 year olds. I don’t get why it’s so hard for people to wrap their head around some adults enjoy games, it’s free and has some quality experiences! When I play WZ I don’t even feel like I’m on roblox. But heck, I even play Minecraft and join other experiences like Outlaster and Piggy. They are really well made and FREE. 

My son thinks it’s so cool that his mom plays with him and while I cringe when he tells his friends because their moms think I’m weird, I’m happy that it makes him happy. My mom and uncles played video games with me growing up and they are some of my favorite memories. We’re a family of gamers I guess.

I have been  told this so many times by my parents.  They where probably scared by something their parents said and just want to be safe.  That still doesn't give them the right to say that.

Keeping your imagination and wonder as an adult is normal and should be perceived more positively but a lot of kids think you have to suddenly be “boring” and “grown up”. I thought it was going to be like that when I was a kid. I’m 24 now and I got my mates into roblox too, half of them are older than me 27, 29 etc. It’s just a video game and these kids are too young to understand that they shouldn’t gatekeep a video game. Just ignore them. In time they’ll grow up and realize how dumb they were acting like that towards you otherwise ignoring them is the best you can do.

Part of it the distaste is on richer players almost always being adults, though I would agree, the negativity also comes from the pedophile stigma but it’s hard to explain to 6-12 year old that this is literally a community you’ve stuck around and helped build from the ground up since they were in their dad’s sack lmao.",hoj2vcx,N/A

The fact that ROBLOX is one community for multiple games feels like home to me.

On the topic of the post though, I have gotten little backlash for being 18. In fact, the open mic has actually helped me meet people who are older than me. Other than that, there is the usage of Discord and a lot of underage kids don't seem to mind I'm an older player. Of course, I don't consider myself their friends, but they might ask me to play a game with them and it's like having younger siblings. Any backlash you're getting from kids is immature or very cautious. The only comments I've seen are from parents themselves.

On another note (read at your own risk), >!ROBLOX has been targeted by many well-known pedophiles and it has been up to us to cancel them.!< Because of this reason, older people on ROBLOX are just a wary tale.

In Bloxburg they would do some RPing with other people while I ran off and did some shifts of Pizza Delivery to build us up some money.

For some, it’s the “creep factor” that comes with older players as it makes the younger players think we are weird (since some but very few players actually do try to hook up with younger players through places like discord) and all that shit as part of the reason, the others are due to the older players complaining about the updates (some of which I agree, suck and that time could have been spent elsewhere such as fixing a few fundamentals in studio such as making the arrow vehicle seat from 2012 work again, or fix the catalog and get rid of all the bot offers for example) and how it ruins the game they grew up with as opposed to the younger players who don’t understand as we came before them (a year or so ago during the bot infestation when they fucked over the catalog, someone posted that same topic wrote a thing saying they don’t understand why we were complaining until a lot of older players  told that user why they are complaining and why they are pissed at some of the updates)",hom70v1,N/A

Can confirm.

I've actually found a good amount of other adults (even substantially older than me!) who play a lot of the same games I do. We all, for the most part, seem to keep to ourselves and people-watch as opposed to being social but still enjoy the games.

There's no shame in enjoying games on Roblox even if you're 18+. Plus, if and when you have kids it's something you can do together that I would've killed for when I was little. My *mom* playing videogames with me? Oh my God yes please. Actually, we play minecraft together now which is awesome, but the point stands.",hokry6a,hoicpfs

I got hooked on world zero and now they have guilds. So I joined one and they have a discord so I use it to keep updated but do not talk to anyone at all. I also added on my profile on both discord and roblox that I’m an adult. I often get asked why I would play roblox even by 18/19 year olds. I don’t get why it’s so hard for people to wrap their head around some adults enjoy games, it’s free and has some quality experiences! When I play WZ I don’t even feel like I’m on roblox. But heck, I even play Minecraft and join other experiences like Outlaster and Piggy. They are really well made and FREE. Also, my son thinks it’s so cool that his mom plays with him and while I cringe when he tells his friends because their moms think I’m weird, I’m happy that it makes him happy. My mom and uncles played video games with me growing up and they are some of my favorite memories. We’re a family of gamers I guess. Also, I know it’s aimed for kids but it also has things that attract adults. The voice chat for example I think should be 18+.

Doesn’t mean people should ridicule every adult on roblox? And if someone is forthcoming about their age and saying “hey bro not cool I don’t hump kids characters in a game because I’m an adult and that’s weird” how are people going to hate on them for being a pedo? That’s the opposite,hoi8ae0,hoi7vbc

With that in mind I’ve played the game 12 years and I’ve never had an suggestive “luring”encounter with any adult like that. 

I’ve heard some people argue against that with condos but as far as I’ve investigated the players that go to those places are curious kids that look it up on the search bar any find a copy-paste place that gets content deleted in like 30 minutes or (scarily enough) organized condos that you need to be verified, invited and vetted before visiting.",hoj4d33,hoi7vbc

The reason most teen developers make games on roblox instead of other game engines is because they simply cannot afford the servers and databases required to host multiplayer games. Plus, roblox provides a nice format and easy to read documentation.

Just because someone is a kid doesn’t mean they cannot make a successful game.

For instance, badcc, one of the creators of jailbreak, is 19. That means he created it when he was 17.",hp4ufc4,hp47sdr

No one really cares if an adult played a ""kids game"".  Or what he's a ""kids movie"", or reads a ""kids book.""

But when a child does an adult activity, it's more of an issue.  Because now the adult(s) in the space have to be aware of the child and what they say or what they do.

An adult isn't going to screw up their perception of the world by playing Mario Brothers, but a child is likely going to screw up their perception of the world playing GTA Online or COD and listening to a bunch of adults talking dirty things while shooting each other.",hot1bs2,hoklllu

My under-ten son is starting to get into Roblox and has his own laptop.  I have parental controls set up on his machine, which includes blocking files running from the Temp folder.

Of course, Roblox loves to update itself from its downloaded files in that folder and it keeps failing due to the parental controls.  Since Roblox (for some bizarre reason) names every download attempt as a different filename, I can't simply give that file permission and let it run.  It downloads a new file with a new name and fails again.  Endless loop.

I've had to shut off parental controls for the moment, and am unhappy about it.  Seems like a game geared towards kids would be able to deal with parental controls.

Is there a workaround anywhere?  Thanks!",N/A,N/A

Run the Roblox installer as admin *from the child's account*.

After Roblox finishes installing, give that folder read+write+modify permissions from your child's account.

Delete the start menu shortcuts and make new ones pointing to the location in /Program Files (x86) or /Program Files (if you're running 32bit).

The result will be a Frankenstein mess that's usually representative of a poorly coded program - but it runs.

Known problems:

* Roblox does *not* like running from Program Files and will still try to load its stuff from Temp (but it's playable).
* Roblox Studio -- used to develop games -- will instantly crash because it can't create the settings file it's looking for (Processes require ownership of the folder they're in to create certain file types including .xml -- which you can't do with Program Files under windows 10)
* Custom decals and music will download but fail to load
* Special control modes (like hooking up an xbox controller or using a VR headset) will fail since they require special Studio settings to be set before they will work
* Unfortunately, the launcher plugin used for Chrome and Edge is looking to launch the copy of ROBLOX located inside Temp... So you need to change whichever internet browser shortcut you use to the local copy that usually gets installed inside Program Files, so it looks there instead.
* Updates will download and run an installer automatically... But it won't run as admin so it'll try to create stuff in Temp once again *unless you edit one of the registry keys to point to the Program Files location*",dd1669j,N/A

The ACS system is cool and all but the mechanics are super unnecessary for a game like Prison Life, the punching system is super basic and unreliable instead of using a raycast hitbox system which is 10 times better, the buildings are inconsistent some are super detailed and some literally looks like it was stolen from DooM this inconsistency problem is also a problem in the entire game. Like you see a super high-poly car then you see low-poly trees.

Introduction of ""layered clothing"" which nobody uses simply because the normal clothing just looks better, fits better, is less complicated, and is more common having been around since the beginning of time   

The most popular ga...I mean ""experiences"", do seem to be either pet sim, brookhaven, murder mystery, and like 15 different anime fighting simulators that all the kids seem to like.

Egg hunts are over forever, seasonal events too. Events now are usually just sponsorships for brands or artists not many people care about with mediocre at best items for them.

The mobile ui, soon to become the pc ui, has become way worse as well. It will become ever harder to find specific items in the catalog due to the new ui not allowing specific prices to be looked up, and not having infinite pages (around 17 before it just stops, i believe)
Menus are confusing, but you'll get used to them.

Roblox added layered clothing like jackets and shoes, as well as some hair. These items are awful, as they dont fit well on actual roblox avatars, only rthro characters, and they dont work in R6.

The playerbase has become younger with a new surge of players who joined during the pandemic.

A majority of the top games now are click-to-swing-your-sword-and-get-strength type games with an anime coat of paint (i've seen a lot of one piece and jojo ones), people continue to create games like this because they're easy moneymakers and not because they have a unique, creative concept.

A lot of roblox developers and youtubers are beginning to come out as predators. Some hat creators have pornography on their main social media accounts. Shit's wild, and its the main reason why i dont buy items from certain creators.

If there's any positive things on roblox right now, it would be the new profile pictures coming soon, where you can pose your avatar using emotes and zoom in and out, the current bloxy event (which they changed the name to to sound more corporate) has some decent items to grab, and that many good games on the site still have a decent playerbase.",ihgeq1u,N/A

on budget u have red magic (not recommended)
it's just for people who like to game on phone and nothing else, bad camera etc

medium level is lenovo legion duel (recommended) all phones here use snapdragon 888, great battery life and don't heat much.

very expensive side u got Asus Rog 5 (not recommended unless ur dad millionaire)

the best phone for gaming on market with even programmable side buttons like console.


if u looking at iPhone then let's say.

ur gonna be holding a microwave for quite a while since iphone 14 design leaks show it ain't gonna be any different for gaming.

there is a channel search on youtube "" mrwhoestheboss best gaming phone""

The settings are set to ""automatic"" for every device by default so little kiddies won't get confused if their game runs worse than a car with an engine set on fire (which it still does anyway)

I think it's fair that they keep the presets for those who have no brain cells but also allow us to change settings such as: anti-aliasing, depth of field, render distance and shadow quality etc if we wanted to.

Like I seriously don't want to have to set render distance at maximum just to have anti-aliasing enabled (preset 9), I want to turn render distance down while having other settings turned up so that I get a good performance to quality ratio if that makes sense.",hodhz6g,hodcn7f

Please somebody tell me. I'm not into Roblox my son is however. He is almost 8yrs old. For the past few weeks there's an event every 7 days which I pay for. If I say 'no' my son gets upset and it's hard for me to watch him hurt. So I end up buying robux so that he can do events. This game turned into another weekly bill. I'm so frustrated with this game and I wish I could simply smash this iPad into pieces!! Also he asks about buying ' skins' etc. To me this game is a rip -off . When will this event thing end??? I can't be paying for this forever!! Another thing is that my son behaves funny around this game. Whenever I enter the room he logs out to main Roblox home page . He said that he just doesn't want me to see how he plays as he is not good at it. He never acted like this with other Nintendo games. With this Roblox he acts secretive. Yesterday I saw on the screen as i was behind him figure called ' Noob Boy,' he said that he is not going to show me him . Last week he asked me to buy glasses for this Noon Boy which I did. Today he doesn't want to show me him at all. I don't know what is going on within this game but it frustrates me every week even more.",N/A,N/A

Roblox is a website full of multiple games and recently, thanks to the site going onto the stock market, many brands have took over the website with games seeking to make money off ""gamepasses"" a virtual advantage in the games available. If you're looking to make your kid happy, then join in on the game with him, see if it's a good game. To make your kid sad, either ask roblox support for his account to be shut down (you get no refunds for the virtual items he bought) or tell him no whenever he asks for money. 

As for this ""noob boy"", it shouldn't be a threat. I cannot get a picture as of now but noobs typically are a friendly little figure/avatar on roblox that have a yellow head and arms with a blue torso and green legs.

Perhaps telling your child about how important your money is to survive, especially in today's world, might stop him from begging. If he continues to beg then ignoring him would be the best option.

One of roblox's selling points is you can use your account and access your items in any game on any device. If you have someone's password you can log into their account.

Post,https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/hbmcv1/how_do_i_prove_my_parents_that_roblox_is_safe/,How do I prove my parents that Roblox is safe?,WindyWhirls,2020-06-18,1592512227.0,41,"How do I prove my parents that Roblox is safe?
Whenever my parents catch me playing Roblox, they tell me to stop playing because *""Roblox is malware and it will key-log and steal your information.""* or something around those lines. They've been saying this for the past 7 years now and it's getting on my nerve. But how do I tell them that it isn't a virus?   
Every time I try and tell them that it isn't, they look at me as if I don't know what I'm talking about. I did my research.. There's around 60 million people registered on there, and mostly every friend I've asked and forum post I've gone on says that Roblox is safe! If it wasn't safe, then why are so many people and kids playing it?  


They only came to that conclusion of it being a virus after one of my grandparents old computers I played Roblox on had a virus, and connected the dots to conclude that **Roblox** = **Virus**.. which makes no sense because I've played it on my computer for about a year and had no issues. But I'm guessing they like to assume that kids break things and that it is Roblox's fault because I downloaded it.  


I'm asking on Reddit because I think getting input from other people might help me prove a point considering my parents believe everyone is wrong but themselves. If anyone has any tips to proving Roblox is safe, it'd be greatly appreciated!",N/A,N/A

DESPITE THE FACT that Roblox abides to COPPA laws (Privacy and Cookie Policies, Roblox Support). They don't want to leave their ground, no matter how wrong I prove them. They even went out of their way to say that every parent who lets their kids play this game are dumb (How ironic..)
