https://www.reddit.com/r/RobloxParents/comments/ol023p/my_son7_was_able_to_evade_the_roblox_chat_block/,my son(7) was able to evade the ROBLOX chat block,AnotherSpaceNut,1626377421.0,"So bedtime arrives and my son needs to log off Roblox I go to his room to tell him its bedtime.I find he has access to a chat I'm greeted with the words ""I am just saying goodnight"" on screen is Car Destroying Simulator with a chat box open with the discord parody name ""bloxcord"" (cross server chat)Despite the account controls (at Roblox account level) disallowing chat due to the fact he has ASD and a tendency to be open with information.

This raises all kinds of alarm bells in my mind with other children globally who may be in a similar position.

I would advise any parent in this situation to 1) check if your little ones have played this and if so maybe check any new friend adds.

i joined this community to post this so I am sorry if its against any community standards I'm not here to scaremonger parents or badmouth the platform or even the developers of this game but it caused me a great concern
