Idk that there’s any way to avoid old creepy pedophiles in this day and age but look at parental features, teach your child internet safety, look at what he’s actually playing or play as well, and set time limits for those types of games that don’t necessarily provide any education content would be my advice.

I know how unhelpful that sounds, but there really is no way around it. At this age, you opened pandora's box by allowing her to start the game in the first place. You need very clear expectations and rules for how long and when she gets to play. Use timers. Enforce it. Maybe she earns the game for a positive action? Whatever works for you. Make sure you explain *why* videogames are limited (brain junk food, no time for school/sleep, no family connection, etc.).

Her brain is addicted to the stimulus and it is a novelty. It might take time to wean her off. So you could start reducing her play time gradually. If you try and cut her off cold turkey, it will likely just lead to power struggles and anger. She likes this and YOU allowed it, so now arbitrarily taking it away is going to feel very unfair and confusing. The ultimate goal is to achieve a predictable, mutually agreed outcome in which she can have her game. And once she sort of gets used to *not* having it constantly and starts finding other ways to fill her time, she might not ask for it as much.

FYI, you should monitor her activity closely in the game. My kids aren't into this one personally, but I have heard it is possible for creeps to interact with kids if they have public access. I don't know how it works because, as I said, this isn't a favorite in our house. But you should look into it.",irlk3yf,N/A

We had a new baby and it kept him occupied during the time. He enjoyed it but he began to spend all of his time doing exactly what your daughter is doing. And his behavior was suffering too. Just epic meltdowns, super moody and not himself. Because of meltdowns/tantrums, we took away the PlayStation and tablet for two weeks at a time. First few days were brutal but he started going back to the things he used to love. Drawing, independent play, going outside, etc. He obviously needed more direction and help finding the next task to do to keep him occupied, but I don’t regret it. Then when he would get his tablet and stuff back, he would play for awhile and then randomly get bored and do something else. 

Much like adults when you decide your indulging too much into something and you try and fill your time with other things, that one big thing starts to lose its hold over you.

On school days my kids are not allowed screen time in the morning or after school (they need to get ready in the am and do homework or help out after school then they can play) but after supper they can have screen time until an hour before bedtime then it’s time to get ready for bed and read for half hour or so. This gets them about an hour- 90 mins a day for screens on weekdays depending on when we have supper.  weekends they have screen time before I get up in the morning then not again until after supper so probably 2-3 hours on the weekend. I find because it’s our routine they don’t really fight me on it as they know when there will be time for screens.

Once you establish this, stick to it.  It'll suck for a while because once it sinks in, she won't like it but tell her she's free to do any other activity other than things associated to a screen.",irmkb99,N/A

The big problem I see with my own five year old is that he asks for video games when he's feeling too tired or uncomfortable to entertain himself. Playing a game and having to stop just delays satisfying the need he needs to satisfy, so he melts down at the end.

So, my rule is that before playing, he has to have had a drink, eaten something of substance within the last hour, and gone to the toilet. If there has been evidence of overstimulation or poor regulation during the day so far, he can't play (not as a punishment, but because he'll probably have more difficultly holding himself together). 

And then I set an alarm for twenty minutes if it's a solo game (like teach your monster to read) or half an hour for a game he needs help for (like Spiro the dragon). He can finish the level/life/savepoint stage after the timer goes off, but not start a new one.

And then don’t cave no matter what - that is the most important part. Every time he has the fit, he loses it for a day - potentially longer if a day turns out to not be long enough. My son is a bit older, so the “not good for your brain” has been explained more and now I can say that being addicted to video games isn’t good for his brain - and feeling this upset about turning them off is a sign that he’s getting addicted, so time for a game break.

We did so many different gymnastics classes! Found out she hates soccer- loves to run, loves to kick, doesn't love running around and trying to kick a ball. She was HXC addicted to her iPad, which we gave back to her biomom and got her an android tablet we could control. She's still got an unhealthy relationship with technology, but it's much better than it used to be. We made changes incrementally and made sure to get her buy-in every step of the way. We used to limit her to 2 hours on weekdays, 3 on weekends but she would spend the entire time on YouTube. We recently changed it to unlimited time on weekdays and weekends, but we've limited YouTube to 1 hour. She will take a break from anything else to play with her toys or color, but YouTube would have her glued to that screen for hours on end.

A 12 yr old is old enough to start learning financial responsibility. I personally would recommend a prepaid debt card that she can use for these subscriptions using her own money that she's been able to save up or that she works for. These can be reloaded when they run out which also gives you the ability to limit her on how much she can spend. If there's no money on the card her subscriptions will automatically cancel and you xan take the opportunity to teach her how to cancel the subscription she pays for. If a prepaid card feels like too much you can also manage subscriptions with gift cards that can only be used on specific apps. She needs to be able to see how her money is being spent. Teaching her how to use a budget can also help her. But this will only work if you follow through with establishing boundaries with grandma. I'd also give her an electronics time out. She abused phone privileges so she looses the phone for a set amount of time. When you give it back make sure she understands why she lost the phone and what the consequence was and that it will be taken away for longer if it happens again. If she values having a phone she will respect the boundaries. I might recommend that if a phone is important for communication then if the problem persists after taking it away more than once then you xan downgrade her to a flip phone that only has minutes. These were things my parents did in similar situations when I was her age and it made a huge difference. You got this mama!,j39v4lf,N/A

She basically told us, in no uncertain terms that ANY online platform or game where chat is a function is a breeding ground for predators and it is never a matter of “if,” but definitely a matter of “when” someone unsavory contacts a child.  It’s not limited to Roblox, there were dozens of apps and games she listed that she regularly catches predators from…it was jarring and my husband and I just decided to not promote or allow those games for our kids.  They can play a lot of games (meaning we don’t punish them, we tell them why we don’t like certain games and we provide plenty of alternatives) but Roblox was a BIG one that the detective mentioned so we have sort of banned it from the get go.

1. Explain what is wrong and why it is wrong.
Throw in an explanation of what you felt when you saw this.

2. Monitor his activities. He's not old enough to navigate the complex social interactions on the internet on his own.
You need to have full insight into what he says in which settings. Get a keylogger in a worst case scenario.
It's either monitored internet or no internet.

3. STRICT end time for internet usage. Your router can most likely restrict when his devices can connect to the internet. Leverage it.

4. If he's on a Windows computer, use the parental controls from Microsoft to monitor app/game usage, browsing history and more.

My knee jerk reaction is to take away his online privileges. If you were to do that, you'd be taking away so much more than just online privileges. You would essentially be socially cutting him off (unless there are irl friends he has). This fact has me thinking that you should only use this as a last resort. Maybe use this as a boundary if the behavior continues?

Honestly though, the behavior is pretty normal around that age group. Is it gross? Yes, absolutely. Have a talk with him. Sit down and discuss how the things he's saying are offensive,  how it makes you feel, and that you don't want him broadcasting that type of energy. Then you can wrap up the conversation with. ""If I see this again, your privileges will be revoked."" This way you can clearly establish what your expectations are and what happens if he fails to meet those expectations.

Well... at 9 it's quite early to have sexual interests, but then again I watched porn at 8 so can't judge.

So still within normal range, although suspicious.

>Seeing those messages has got me worried and got me curious on what led him to say such things… he likes to play games such as minecraft and roblox. He’s homeschooled-online schooling, so his friends who likes to play games has a discord server that they use to socialize and use while they’re playing… he also watches a lot of YT videos of gamers.

Which gamers? Which games?

Roblox/Minecraft/YouTubers are not monoliths.

>Thinking abt those two factors has led me to assume that he might have picked up some bad content from some gamers (I sometimes overhear them saying bad words or trolling words that are inappropriate) or some of his friends might have said it.

Those are plausible reasons. However...

>But of course, I’m not totally sure

Then ask him directly.

>I just want to know how is the best way I can talk to him about this as I don’t just plainly want to say that its bad or shame him about it or say that he’s young enough to understand because he does and has already an idea to it.

My 10 year old twins have completely different personalities. Twin 1 got into all of this ""sex stuff"" a while ago, because he's more outgoing, and he belongs to a friend group with kids screaming ""69"" and ""Ooh daddy harder"" literally EVERY. SINGLE. FREAKING. SECOND. (I've been monitoring his interactions with this group.) Twin 2 is a bit more innocent and shy, and he hasn't even gotten the sex talk yet, (I was forced to give it to T1 because of an incident with his friends.) This innocence is slowly fading away because of school, and his brother and sister teaching him about all sorts of sexual crap. (I talked to them about it.) Both of them use messenger kids and discord. When T1 talked to his friends on discord, I caught him spamming 69 and things like ""U probably f\*ked \*girl's name\* last night"". Instead of panicking, I drank a glass of wine, and bought a book for the sex talk called ""sex is a funny word."" I taught him about how having sex is normal, and it's ok to be curious, but it is only for adults, and you should not talk/joke about this with friends. I also told him about how it's not ok to touch someone else's privates, and it's also not ok for someone to touch yours. (I mainly told him about this because one of his best friends is a girl, and I don't want anything to happen when they are both older.) It was kind of awkward, but now he knows wrong from right.

It seems to ebb and flow. She has type 1 diabetes, and as part of her care team, she has a psychologist that we work with to help her with her mental health. Lots of teaching through example and checking in with her. 

So my advice is this: the next time this happens, where you can see her mood turning difficult and disrespectful, take a step back and ask her is everything okay. If she gets defensive or rude, shoot her down calmly, explaining that you don't want to fight, point out that she seems stressed (because more often than not, in my experience, whatever is causing her stress or mood, usually has nothing to do with me at all) and say you're just checking in and you're there if she needs to talk. See if she wants a hug.

This tactic works almost every time for me and it teaches my daughter that she can come to me for support in times where things are getting the better of her. It shows her that we can tackle these problems together and that there's no shame in having her feelings and acknowledging them. We try to find proactive solutions to whatever is bothering her, which is a great tool for her to learn.

It also heads off a lot of arguments at the pass. So then when things are a bit calmer, I can talk to her about the value of being able to speak to each other with respect and understanding.

Obviously this isn't foolproof, and we've had plenty of arguments, and she can be a brat when she wants, but it's a great way to handle difficult moments, and not only with kids, I've found lol.

My son isn't medicated because it's not general practice in my country to medicate kids with ADHD. I have a nice relationship with my son. He confides in me, he likes to spend time with me and wants to include me in his activities. But I'm not a robot. I get snippy sometimes, I get frustrated sometimes and even angry (rarely, but still). I don't scream at him or hit him. My husband is in the ""good cop"" department too. It's pretty easy for him to be in that role since he's away so much, so I'm mostly the one enforcing the rules. And bingo, my son is ""afraid of me"". At least, that was what I thought because I had the feeling he valued my opinion too much, he used to tell my husband sometimes ""mom will be upset if I do this or that"", as he got older he had those sprouts when he would try to take care about me too much... I talked about it to his psychiatrist and psychologist. During one assessment, a long time ago, my son turned his head towards me before answering to almost all the questions the psychologist asked him. I couldn't understand why he had the need to do that, looked like he wanted to check on me and my reaction before talking and it looked to me like he was afraid of my reaction. It broke my heart to see that and I couldn't understand where that fear was coming from. Both the psychologist and the psychiatrist told me it's not fear as I understand it and I'm doing nothing wrong. When one parent is more or less absent a child takes notice of that fact and sees the mostly present parent as his one and only lifeline. Kids are subconsciously aware that the only thing separating them from the outside potentially ""threatening"" world are their parents. Usually the ""pressure"" is equally divided between both present parents as they are both viewed as lifelines, but when one parent is absent most of the ""pressure"" can be put on the present parent. In other words the child feels like the present parent is their ""rock"" and their only ""protector"" so they can shape their behavior accordingly. Apparently it's a perfectly normal reaction psychologically speaking. The other parent falling into the ""good cop"" role is also expected and common in those kind of scenarios.  Anyway, you and your child aren't the real problem here, your husband is. He should be aware that it's so very easy for him to play the ""good cop role"" since he's not there a lot. He should also understand that it's perfectly normal for you not to completely hide your emotions in front of your child as long as your behavior isn't abusive (and it isn't). Hiding your negative emotions would send your daughter the message that her negative emotions aren't normal either and that she should completely hide them too which is not a good path to take. We all have negative emotions sometimes, we all get frustrated and upset sometimes, but what is important is how we react to those emotions. Not screaming, being aggressive in any way is the way to go. So when I get angry or frustrated while enforcing a certain boundary and my son can see it I don't hide it or negate the way I feel. If he asks me if I'm upset, I tell him in a calm voice what I feel (short sentence) while keeping enforcing the boundaries and telling him that even though I'm upset in that particular moment I love him very much and I always will. 
My child's psychologist told me a year ago that our relationship is a delight to see, so I must be doing something right. I still think my son values my opinion too much and I'm working on him ""not caring much about what I think"" which my child's psychologist told me is so funny for him to see since people usually complain about the opposite behavior. Lol
Maybe talk to your husband, try to bring him to your child's specialist and voice your concerns there. It might help him understand you and your child more and deal with the situation with more understanding. Even if he's in a ""good cop"" role generally speaking, you should present a united front whenever your child is misbehaving because a child will use the rift they sense between their parents to their advantage to manipulate the situation and get what they want. ADHD doesn't mean your daughter  cannot be misbehaving and needing to be corrected. Sometimes it's hard to see a difference between the diagnosis and misbehaving, but it can be seen and a specialist can help you with that part too (I know it helped us).

That will only confuse a child, especially one with ADHD. I would tell him “you’re making this harder on me and you have to stop”. If he has problems with how you’re approaching the situation, you both should discuss that in private. 

At the same time, you need a break if you’re losing your temper with her. If she thinks you’re yelling, it really doesn’t matter the semantics of it. It’s clear that you are stressed. Can you hire a sitter one or two nights a week while he’s gone? 

Another thing- losing is EXTREMELY hard for children with ADHD. It’s something we have worked on a long time with my son. Is she on therapy? Is she on a behavior plan at home to help her cope with things like losing. If she is not, getting her into these things will help you tremendously.",j2ly6v8,N/A

I can't say who is right or wrong, probably everyone (you your daughter and your husband) are all right in some ways in this situation. She should be allowed to feel her feelings but you have to teach her healthy coping mechanisms and emotional regulation not just consequences.

It's a tough life for sure (I know first hand, except I don't have a husband who comes home sometimes), but your mind frame on it is what will make it good or bad. Some days seriously just suck but MOST days are going to be defined by your mindset.

Your frustration with your husband I completely understand. Unfortunately he's not going to see it from your view because he's only doing a fraction of the parenting so he can't understand.

Take your mom power back. Handle this with both hands on the wheel. Your kid needs some grace and patience. Eating after tooth brushing a few times will not rot out her teeth. She needs to follow the rules, but whatever happened the night you made her brush her teeth stayed with her in a bad way. She likely was scared. Otherwise I doubt she'd even remember it by now. Learn to let the reins loosen up a bit. Only then can you truly guide your family from the front. A parent who sees their kid as a chore and micromanages their child always appears weak and like a challenge to be defeated for the child. She'll relax when you do.

I have ADHD myself, also unmedicated, something that seriously has helped is DBT and using the skills that are taught in DBT. You can find free copies of the skills online if you want. 

I feel like you were handling it properly, your husband just hasn't gotten the full picture of what happens when you're parenting. He might need to take a step back and just observe for a bit to see what happens, then you both can make adjustments.

This is something that occurs between 10 and 13 on average. This is the best time to teach empathy and emotional intelligence. First, model the behavior yourself. Second, talk with her about how others feel. Do it as an exercise and not a lecture: “do you remember that very angry person in front of us at the shop; what to you think they were feeling? How do you think they were making others feel? What would have been a more considerate way to act?” 

Over time, you can turn this into conversations about her behavior. “When you do this, how do you feel? How does it make others feel? What would have been a more considerate way to act?” Don’t treat it as punishment. 

Wisdom and compassion come in one of three ways: you learn it through personal experience, you learn it from the wisdom of others, or you learn it through therapy or academic study. Personal experience is normally negative: like when you do the wrong things and reflect on the social consequences. Wisdom from others is modeled and taught. Therapy only works if the person wants to change. Academically it only works if that a desire for the person to lean. 

That means the only control you have is to model the behavior and share your wisdom. Reinforce these lessons with love and affection to remind her that in the journey she is still accepted by you. Do this now because waiting until she is 15-18 is going to make teaching it that much harder. 

Also, now is a great time to find that second voice. Parents at this age of a child become less wise/cool in the eyes of a child. Having a mentor, coach, or teacher reinforce those values as a second voice can be a game changer. Finding ways to let her connect with someone outside of the house can really help in the context of teaching emotional intelligence, compassion, and wisdom even if those lessons don’t take hold for another 5 years.",j95aakm,N/A

I have multiple times/week a conversation with her about some things that happen like in school, which are 100% the result of her not giving a shit about other people feelings. so i usually be calm and try to explain it, asking how she would feel if a friend just abandoned her because there another kid in school that's cooler now... or somethigns like that. She does understand it the message, and makes up a resolution on her own as a conclusion, but the implementation is rare as the rest of society isn't really wired like that.

There was one ""teachable moment"" a few weeks ago, as she did manhandle the cat's like all the time, despite me telling her that this isn't a nice thing to do and just because the cat trust her, and is much smaller than her, does not provide automatic permission to do this.

At some point i just started to do the same to her, and right after asked her opinion about how it feels, after telling me .. i just responded .. ""now you know how the cat feels"" :) 

that actually worked, she stop doing it. even if i'm not around, but that happend in the concealed space at home, where i have full control about everything that happens, once i'm out of sight, this things usually just snap right back to business as usual.",j95esqh,j95aakm

Also, YouTube is not currently subject to regulatory laws around advertising to kids, so some of these creators push self promotion to the extreme. I’ve seen videos aimed at children where over half the video was self promotion. This can be very predatory on young children.

1. Talk to your daughter about internet safety and etiquette in general .

2. Have an honest conversation about predators. The internet is like being at an amusement park. You may 5alk to the person in li e next to you but you do not give them identifiable information. [videos for kids 10 and under about safety, predators, and what to](https://www.missingkids.org/netsmartz/intothecloud?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5vKX14jh9AIVg5qGCh2a3AZSEAAYAiAAEgL9L_D_BwE)

3. Get the user name of the person talking to her on roblox. Contact roblox and request that this account and all future accounts created by this person be blocked from accessing your daughter.  Also let them know you suspect it is a predator. If parents and kids don't report, the company doesn't know.

4. Find out what she enjoys about roblox. Minecraft is similar but from what my students tell me safer.

5. Start building an open relationship with your daughter. She needs to know she can tell you about her life without judgment or punishment. 

6. Leave her in school. You can not control her actions, she is an individual with her own thoughts and feelings.  If you pull her out of school, most likely she will resent you.

That said, don’t feel guilty if you want to say something about it. It’s actually not a bad thing to let your kiddos know if you need some quiet time or changes in topic from time to time. 

Teaching kids to have empathy for others is a great life skill for not only at home but for social normals with others - no one would want to listen about how pink sparkly shoes are the best shoes in the world for hours, right? (Sorry, it’s a weird, random example but hang in there with me).  

Or maybe it’s been a long/ bad day and you’re just not in a mental state where you can hear one more freaking random fact about minecraft without wanting to pull your hair out, despite all the love you have for your child and not wanting to crush their soul/spirit/willingness to share with you in the future.

BUT the REALLY important part in teaching these lessons is that you 

- DON’T tell them / teach this lesson when they are in the middle of sharing otherwise you risk hurting your child and making them feel unconfident in wanting to share with you again in the future.

- DO share with them how much you love that they are excited and happy about the topics they bring up. That it’s awesome to share with people you love and you know care about you .

- DO listen when they share, even when it’s not a topic you really care about. It’s important to them and it’s the same way you would want to be treated when talking to a friend, right?  

- DO give them time to talk and after actively listening and asking engaging questions, go ahead and change subjects to let your child know it’s time for something new to talk about. If they don’t get it, you can always say “It was really fun to hear about your Minecraft Story today but I would also LOVE to hear about ....” 

- DO share and talk about things you like or are excited about with your child too!  It’s a great way for them to learn about being good listeners and getting an understanding of how healthy conversations work. (Keep in mind of your audience and where they are at developmentally though when bringing up your topics - you might have to talk in excited tones and include/exclude different facts when talking to a five year old but for a teenager you could have a less animated and more factual discussion.)

- DO tell your kids when you are having a rough time or are in need of a break and try to tell them in advance so you can avoid hurt feelings. 
Example I’ve told my kids: “Hey, I love you guys! I just want to give you the head’s up that mom here has had a bit of a rough day. I would be super grateful if we could talk and share things later when I know I’m not in a grumpy mood and I can give you the my best listening ears and attention that you deserve.“

And make it something fun between the two of you as well. My grandpa and I bonded over video games. He would play them and show me whatever he was playing when I came over. It’s one of my best childhood memories (even if the games were maybe a bit inappropriate haha but it never bothered me) and I think it’s why I still love video games today. I have been so excited to do the same thing with my kids. 

So far, they really love any games we share. My oldest and I played Sword and Shield together (she was 6-7 at the time) and she loved meeting up to battle the bigger Pokémon together. And just sharing how far we had gotten, tips for beating gyms, stuff like that. 

My youngest (currently 6) loves playing Mario Party or Big Brain Academy together. Or any game she sees me or her sister interested in. She just wants to be included. 

I don’t usually do the hard parts for them. I do occasionally make exceptions, like my youngest for some reason gets anxious about playing Bowser’s Big Blast in Mario Party so I just pick the color for her. 

I don’t make them keep going in a game if they want to quit. We have so many games that they jump around and always come back to the hard game eventually, so I don’t feel the need to force it. I take breaks from games when I get frustrated and come back to it, so I don’t see this an a bad thing.

I installed the switch parental control app on my phone so he can only play for an hour a day during the week and 1.5 hours on the weekends. Exceptions if it's family playing together- right now all three of us are playing through an old Marvel game so we do an extra hour if he wants. I've got a vague balance running in my head of hours of physical exercise outdoors = hours of screen time. When he gets super frustrated we generally just encourage him to keep trying, and talk him through the steps- the sense of accomplishment he gets when he manages something is worth it. 

We borrow switch games from our local libraries, and I'd really recommend it. 2 weeks gives you long enough to figure out if your kid likes a game enough to put it on a birthday or Chriatmas list.

This is the reason why there are so many games on the platform. There’s a lot of new games being added frequently.  Game creators can add in game purchases (purchased with Robux) which can be special features like unlimited in game currency, special boosts like being able to jump higher, unlock special packs, etc. It’s not necessary to buy these, sometimes it makes the game faster and easier.

There are many different types of games in Roblox.

My family enjoys the “tycoon” games. Where you earn “money” or whatever you’re collecting in the game and build your “base” or whatever you’re building in the game. There’s zoo tycoons (building and customizing your own zoo), Pizza restaurant tycoon, store tycoon, mall tycoon, etc. 

Since there are a lot of games that are NOT appropriate for little kids, it’s best to monitor them and even play with them. We’ve been playing it for a few years and LO only plays on Roblox when we’re playing with them. They’re also only allowed to play games that we have played ourselves and added to their favorite list so we know it’s appropriate. 

To name a few of our favorite games:

like Work at a Pizza Place, which allows you to earn money by “working” in various positions in a pizza restaurant, and you can buy furniture for your home in game, make your house bigger, buy clothes and accessories in that game. 

Club Roblox is a roleplaying game where it’s a city, you have your own house (that you can customize, upgrade, change), work in different buildings, roleplay in other careers like hospital, police station, daycare,etc. 

Build a boat for treasure is where you build a boat using blocks and if you can pass the course at the end there is a treasure chest where you can earn coins and new building materials. 

There’s a firefighter game (not sure what it was called) is great for little kids because you get to drive around the city in the firetruck and put out fires. 

Bee swarm simulator is a game where you collect pollen from flowers, take it to your hive where your bees make honey, and you use the honey as “money” to unlock more bees, bee hive spots, and to upgrade your tools.

There’s also shooting games (for older kids and adults)… we don’t play those. but there is a game called Big Paintball that we play sometimes which is just 2 teams (blue vs red) trying to get the other team. My husband found a game like Rust that he enjoys playing as well. 

There’s a whole bunch of different kinds of games that’s good for little kids and it’s fun for parents to play with their kids too. If you play it with little kids you can set their profile to their age and it won’t show inappropriate words in the chat for kids under (13 I think?) which is based on the age on their profile. You can also turn off the chat to prevent kids from seeing any chat at all (from other players) and it also prevents them from being able to chat. There’s even an account restriction which only allows curated content, from what I’ve seen from using this though, there are some games (like Work at a Pizza place) that aren’t allowed. I think you can still see all the games but it will only allow you to play specific games.",hjkc2mx,N/A

It’s better for her to hear the truth from you than misinformation from others. 

A funny, relevant story: When I was exactly ten, I told my dad I was half-lesbian. He was extremely taken aback, wasn’t sure where I had learned about it, and started asking more questions. (This was way before Discord btw. Kids just find out.) Anyway, turns out I asked my grandma what lesbian meant and she said it’s the same thing as Lebanese. She was trying to avoid the conversation and didn’t think I was old enough. So in my mind, lesbian=Lebanese were interchangeable. I thought that for months. A very educational moment for us both and I was thrilled he was honest and open with the definition of lesbian, unlike my grandmother was, as I immediately felt the failure she set me up for by not explaining it to me when she could. Thank goodness my dad was open, honest, and gentle with the explanation or I could have embarrassed myself horridly in a different situation.",iwegikd,N/A

From what I know, you can meet and text chat with total strangers very easily in Roblox. I would be concerned about her potentially ending up is a discord call with an adult or older kid she doesn’t know.

If she is truly *only* chatting and playing with friends who you know, then I don’t think it’s a concern. They would have the same conversations in real life. 

But as a long-time gamer, I would personally be concerned that she may be interacting with people outside of the friends you are aware of.

With Roblox, the first step is to turn off the chat function, and agree together how to manage and monitor ‘friends’. Sit together and agree the criteria for adding friends. Annoyingly, this is what almost every platform calls any other user you connect with. For kids, a friend is a friend is a friend. Not a random. This is sadly not as easy as blocking or banning or any other one-click action. It’s a series of conversations and sharing with each other, so your child understands that people aren’t alway who they say they are, and randoms online aren’t necessarily the same as friends offline. 

If it’s not Roblox today, it’ll be something else. It’s good to start today. And be honest. Tell her that you’re sorry, and worry, and can see she’s feeling hurt. You will both be fine.

I’m not sad about it. I felt more pressure when forced to interact in lessons and other social activities and despite these social interaction ordeals I don’t struggle socially as an adult. Just it’s all within my terms where as a child you don’t always get a choice.

You could argue you don’t get a choice interacting within work environments but as an adult we choose those environments we are in. 

You’re son despite the challenges will likely find a group of friends whom are friends for life and stick with them. This happened for me at 17, because I got to choose who I wanted my friends to be. School and social things from the age of 10 is meaningless to me. 

I say above because your son sounds somewhat chilled about it and that was me. But all I’d say is keep checking up on him, because that doesn’t mean that on those odd days I didn’t feel lonely, just as a whole didn’t bother me.

Edit: ooo and I find verbal positivity extremely helpful and I’m using it on my daughter… e.g. “you’ve got this.” And “wow you’re really brave.” My daughters a lot younger than 10… but I just want her to believe in herself no matter what a day brings.",ir0tmwj,N/A

It might help to step back and consider the big picture of your entire school year... taking a month off of screens might feel like a huge setback but if it saves your year and makes the rest of your time more productive... maybe worth it? In that time you take off screens you could maybe try redirecting his attention into things like educational board games or borrowing a large selection of books on different subjects and see what piques his interest and go from there. And then start slowly reintroducing screens with limits once he seems like he's doing better.

The opposite approach could be to lean into it... I don't know about roblox but minecraft does provide some avenues for creativity and spacial reasoning. Perhaps you could find some way to use this to your advantage? You could agree to let him have more time playing minecraft if he uses that time to say, recreate topography or famous landmarks. Then he'll have to do some research on like the arc de triomphe or whatever in order to build it in minecraft. And maybe you could get him to write some notes on it while he's working on it.

Some good ideas for open ended toys: playdough, blocks, toy cars with a racetrack that he can move around and change the shape of, legos, sensory bins that you can add new stuff to periodically.

Where we live we had a 2 month lockdown (no one was allowed outside except to buy food or in an emergency), with schools and nurseries closed from March until September. Everyone who could had to work from home. Our then 3yo ended up getting a lot more tablet and TV time than we had ever wanted, but what could anyone do? As the restrictions came to an end, we started to reduce screen time. This met with resistance and some of that is still around now (but she's a 5yo, so it's understandable).

Apart from parental controls and specifically banning YouTube (including the kids version), we have a ""no tablets on weekdays"" rule and limit tablet time at the weekend to 30-60 mins a day. Which is probably still too much. If there's drama or tears connected to not having the tablet, it's kept out of reach for a week or two (with a clear explanation that we think it's *because* the tablet has been overused that she's reacting like that). She now accepts that it's up to us to decide when ""that's enough tablet time now"".

IMO it's never too late to start reducing screen time and allowing it only at certain moments. So if you need 30 mins to cook supper, let that be the tablet half hour, and no other time during the day. Or put Bluey on TV or something, if he won't do something more creative.",ip7c7af,N/A

Now, if you want, I'd try a timer on the tablet. Say he always uses it for four hours a day - set the timer for 15 minutes less (so 3 hours, 45 minutes) for a couple days. Then do 15 more minutes. Once it times out, it's out. Do this every four to five days until you're at a time limit you're okay with him having.

I'd also recommend going through toys and putting some away. Do you have room to rotate books and toys every week or two to keep it exciting? That might help him become engaged in them again.

Maybe it's a hard screentime limit?

It sounds like he's not on a track you want him to be on developmentally, as far as independence, self-sufficiency, and attention. 

However, my 4-year-old has never had a tablet or even held a phone without me also holding it, and I will say cultivating independent play at this age can still be a struggle. 

He's recently begun paying more attention to ""projects"" like elaborate drawings, looking at search and find books like Waldo, and longer pretend play and building. This might be a good time to buy a fun independent toy like our current favorite, Lego.",ip79qzz,N/A

You brought this kid up in a ridiculous time under crazy unprecedented circumstances. So let’s put that part to bed as my most important thing to say.

Moving on, I bought by kid his first iPad at 6, which was pretty late in terms of his friends. And hands down, it was The. Worst. Fucking. Thing. I. Have. Done. In. His. Life. 

He is also an only, and he also wasn’t really the type for natural independent play. It was something we needed to work on and grow with over the years. He has time limits even today (he’s 12). But I’ve lost count of the amount of bickering we’ve had over tablets/online/etc. I’m not trying to raise an Amish kid, but it’s also exceptionally addictive.

I’ve mentioned this guy many times in the past few days, because I read about him and went to his YT channel. His name is The Healthy Gamer.

Another thing, we check with friends parents if kids can play minecraft at ours first. You can also ask that the parents restrict access to certain things when your child is in their care.

Once a week for an hour- okay for some students. It doesn't give them enough time to practice, and, imo compounds the issue of getting stuck on the same piece. 

In my experience, the biggest obstacles to practicing and improvement are: not having a ""fun"" element to their lessons or to their practicing, practicing incorrectly, and trying to practice too much or trying to cram practicing. Shorter amounts of time practicing daily are better than longer amounts occasionally. I would suggest talking to their teacher (if you haven't already) about good practice habits. If they're just playing through the entire piece over and over, for example, it won't help them get better. Lastly, practice sessions should always end with something fun- a piece they have already mastered and enjoy playing, their own composition, a popular song they like, etc.

Kindergarten = ZERO homework. ZERO. Asking you to practice tying shoes with your kid is one thing. Asking you to read ONE book with your kid each night, no big deal.

What you haven't said is how you respond to complaining and whining (and presumably having tantrums) constantly. Your response to this is going to be important in (well mine anyway) a response. 

Draw your line. Make your expectations clean. Set boundaries.... then stick to them. Never... ever... cave or compromise. ""One thing and that's it."" then do the one thing and nothing else. Don't negotiate with terrorists (is my favourite term when talking about dealing with children). 

Im sorry that your early life kinda sucked; and from experience I know how that parlays into overcompensation and spoiling of one's kids. But you're not doing _yourself_, or her to be honest, an favours by not setting reasonable expectations and enforcing limits. 

Next time, before you get her anything, sit her down. ""Hey. ITs Tuesday, that means we go to the store. When we get there, I will get you _ONE_ <thing she wants>. But that's it until next Tuesday and I mean it. No tantrums no complaining"". And then do not under any circumstances go back on that until next Tuesday. If you do this two or three cycles in a row and hold to your restriction (and promise) then Im willing to bet it goes away. 

But during those first few cycles... you're in for a rough time. Whining, complaints. ""Im sorry, I said ONE, you got ONE, that's it until Tuesday."" Be prepared for how you handle a tantrum. My advice: ignore her completely. If she wants to flop on the floor and throw stuff and act like... err.. a 5 yr old having a tantrum, ignore her (I mean, like make sure she doesn't hurt herself, but otherwise..). WHe she gets in your face and screams in your ear, calmly turn to her and say ""Im sorry you feel that way but you're not behaving very nicely. Come back to me when you're willing to behave nicely and not scream in my ear."" Gonna be tough, but it will bear fruit.

This will sound rather cold, but I think its appropriate: as a parent your job isn't to be your child's best friend. If your child winds UP being your best friend, that's a bonus. And of course Im not saying not to love your child to the moon and back and show it every minute of every day. But your job isn't to cater and pamper their every need and whim. Your job is to get them to adulthood. And lead by example. And part of that is learning there are rules and limits and expectations and boundaries. Giving them everything they want when they want isn't going to teach them to be anything but needy, helpless codependent whiners.

edit: another thing as I come back to this a few hours later. You're the parent. Don't feel the need to ever explain or justify any rule or decision to your kids. Just keep it simple. ""Sorry, we can't afford it."" What are they gonna do, audit the books? or ""No. I said no. That's all you need to know. Is no."" or... and this actually worked with my kids: ""Yep I said so. Completely arbitrary reason. Guess what. Im the adult, I get to make up arbitrary rules, Im the parent. Deal with it. When you're the adult you get to make arbitrary rules for you kids. Circle of life. Go ask grandma and grandpa they'll tell ya the same thing. They made arbitrary rules that I thought sucked when I was your age. So Im just passing the buck onto you."" <- I like this one because it shows you acknowledge the unfairness (i.e. acknowledge their pain.. shows _empathy_)... you just don't care.",i3dn243,N/A

When she whines and cries and throws a fit remind her, ""This is one of those lessons. Instead of buying something new, let's talk about the cool things we already have!"" You'll like get something about how nothing she owns is cool and then it's time to bring out the big black bags... ""OK. When we get home, we'll put all the stuff you think isn't cool in big black garbage bags and get it out of your room. We're still not buying anything new though."" 

I'd also remind them of expectations, and put consequences to the actions. Let them know before you go into the store each time, ""We're not buying toys today. We're only buying groceries.""

It sounds like your daughter is trying to get something from you. She's asking for material things because you probably have given her a lot of things (seeing that you ""feel bad"" you've always had trouble bonding with her), so that's what she knows to ask. 
But it might be positive to shift the perspective and give more importance to time spent together, etc... Maybe also to tell her why you appreciate and love her as a person, why she is valuable, and slowly start shifting the narrative you have that you can only provide things and that she needs those things. 
My interpretation might be a stretch, and of you don't recognize yourself in it please ignore my comment. You don't really say enough to make such assumptions, but something told me it might be part of what's going on. And with many people commenting saying you need to tell her no and she must learn, I think it's also important that you learn how to ""give"" differently...

It'd be fun to stay at the playground and slide all night long, even until tomorrow! Or maybe live at the the playground! Where would you sleep?') and taking pictures of items he liked in stores ('We aren't buying anything today, but do you want me to take a picture of it? That would be cool to have, huh?

Also your daughter doesn't need to know about your money situation. It'll sound like too much money if you have a lot and it'll stress her out too much if you don't have enough.

My parents weren't that involved with what I did in my free time (essentially screen time), so I spent most of my time playing video games. I definitely would have preferred it if they tried to  manage my time after looking backon it, but I grew out of it on own and I'm now a perfectly fine student in highschool. 

If you're not already familiar, ""Adopt Me"" is a game where kids can pretend to have families (something of the sort - in terms of appearance it's harmless). A LOT of kids play this game, and I'm pretty sure it's the most popular game on the site. This may give you some false pretenses, but if you think about it, a lot of games out there have many inappropriate ideas in the real world (i.e., shooting people), and it's essentially the same here. 

I personally think it would be extremely uncomfortable for her if you were overly assertive (like others are recommending to be) with stopping her. I think it's better to expose to her more healthy hobbies. We all have weird things we liked to participate in, but it's something that most of us tend to grow out of. Admittedly, if my parents found out about all the stuff I've seen/played, they'd think I'm crazy. But look at me now - I'm a healthy student with great grades and I look back on my past and laugh a bit. Monitor her, but most importantly don’t turn a blind eye.

1. There are many therapeutic options out there other than ABA. If your child isn't in cognitive behavioral therapy or receiving wrap around services, he should be.
2. People with ASD are concerned about ABA for many reasons. It's not really about brainwashing, but there's concern that it teaches kids to mask or 'act neurotypical' in a way that is not healthy. Historically, ABA used abusive practices. Again, there are many therapeutic options out there. ABA is not the only option.
3. Your child is 9yo. You really don't have a lot of control over what he's being exposed to outside of your home. You should simply assume he is being exposed and have a big talk with him about it. You should also come up with a strategy for this kind of issue in the future, because he's only going to be exposed to more problematic language and behavior in the future. 
4. Also, you're incorrect about people with ADHD not learning from their mistakes. They absolutely do. But impulsive behavior and lack of emotional regulation can cause people with ADHD to repeat mistakes. Also, children in general tend to repeat mistakes because they are children.
5. Does your son have a 504 or IEP? Because if he doesn't, he absolutely needs one. Also, he may need adult supervision when it comes to interacting with other children. If the school has a social skills group, he should be in it.

My son has ASD and ADHD. He's 11yo and in 5th grade. Currently, he gets cognitive behavioral therapy once every two weeks (with the option of more if he needs it), and we are currently looking at social skills groups and occupational therapy. At school, he has a 504 and we have the special education department, therapists and teachers all on the same page. He has a support network in place and as soon as any problem arises, we can nip it in the bud and have strategies in place.

Essentially, it doesn't sound your son is receiving the therapy or structure he needs to flourish at school. You both need to go to the school and start talking to therapists to get him set up in a program that will help him succeed.",it4id0s,N/A

If she pushes back hard, remind her that you are a TEAM and that you both should be working towards what is healthiest for your child. 

If she still pushes back strongly, ask her to take some time to reflect, and that you will do the same.  Stay positive, calm and loving.

- he cannot talk to anyone he doesn’t know (parental controls on his Xbox prevent him from using his headset to start parties or talk to people I have not preapproved) 
- he can only play games rated for his age (for example if a game in roblox is rated 13+, he wouldn’t be able to play it) 
- he can only play if I am in the same room to supervise (his Xbox is in the living room, so this isn’t usually an issue) 

I’ve seen some really fun things on Roblox. After sitting with him and watching, even playing with him sometimes, I have learned that Roblox is not inherently bad- 90% of it is fun and appropriate.

She's still young enough you can control her friends. It's a hard no on hanging out with these girls. I had neighbor child write a nasty email and send it to a parent and signed my child's name on it. The drama was ridiculous. I blocked all of them from our phones and socials. Good riddance. Rather figure out who the rotten kids and parents are before high school and I have little control anymore. 

Sign her up for some classes in your area. Martial arts, art, cooking etc. Let her work on making friends in a controlled environment. It helps a lot. Block the girls and change the passwords. If the parents ask just say you don't feel they're a right fit as friends and maybe they can try again when they're older. If they keep bugging you block them as well. 

As for your daughter have some talks on what makes a good friend. Friends should support you. Not find ways to get you in trouble. They should be kind and make you smile. You don't have to be friends with everyone. Etc ect. American Girl makes a book called A Smart Girls Guide to Friendships that's very useful.",idlt3ay,N/A

But I think by 11, in general, kids are old enough to decide for themselves which friends to prioritize, and parents telling them they're not allowed to hang out with certain people takes away opportunities to develop their own values in friendships. That's a really valuable skill. As much as I would love to steamroll any and all mean girls out of 9F over here's way, I think that (within limits of course) there's so much to be gained from having her see on her own that some friends make you feel better about yourself than others, and having me being a loving pair of arms to run into when she's hurt instead of someone who pushes all obstacles out of her way. 

Maybe you could sit her down at a time when things are calm and say something like ""Hey, I was thinking, I don't really know Eliza very well. What are some things you like about her?"" or if you want to make it less targeted at her, maybe you could start a discussion at the dinner table about what makes someone a good friend or a bad friend, with everyone offering their views. Just providing opportunities for her to reflect ""is this someone that genuinely makes me feel good about myself?"" but not forcing her or criticizing her friends yourself. 

Another thing you could try is getting her enrolled in some other activities away from these two that can help her make new friends. Drama classes, art camp, community sports teams, whatever. Or if that's not an option you could try gently nudging her towards other friends, for example, asking, ""Hey, I was going to make pizza tonight. Would you like to invite \[peripheral friend\] over for pizza and a movie?"" 

I do think that ultimately this should be her decision, though. You can be a shoulder to lean on, you can give advice if she asks, but I probably wouldn't try to tell her what to do.",idlrr2s,N/A

I know it sucks because they're in the neighborhood. Her login should have been changed the first time there was shenanigans with the Roblox. She doesn't need to be rude to them, but when they come around, she can remove herself from the situation.

Is it fair? No, not really. The mean kids should be the ones that get the consequences. Sadly, that is just not the way it works out in these situations. I wouldn't go to their parents, because like you said, they're not going to admit it. I would be prepared for one or both sets of parents to ask you what happened, and you can say ""They aren't kind to my kid."" And if they want to fight, just say the conversation is over.

Some moms bake!  My sister is a crunchy mom - she makes the cute bento lunches for her kindergartener, homemade granola bars for her toddler, every dinner is from scratch.  She sews their clothes and does all sorts of neat things like that.  She’s a great mom!

Some moms read and work!  My sister in law is amazingly smart and scholarly.  She teaches university and does research.  Her kindergartener speaks 2+ languages and goes to conferences with her.  She’s a great mom!

Some moms craft and run and game and work full time.  My kindergartener does road races with us and helps pick out colors of yarn.  We play age appropriate games together (Pokémon, skylanders) and they learn how to be strategic and a good winner/loser.  I’m a good mom!

Moms come in all shapes and sizes: we don’t fit the cookie cutter mold of the 50s ideal mom - and that’s okay!  Your kid won’t like everything you like - and that’s okay!  They won’t be traumatized because you have your own interests.  If anything, knowing parents have their own interests and are their own person can help children establish their own personalities, interests, and opinions with less pressure and struggle.
