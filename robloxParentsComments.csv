I have been frustrated since downloading Roblox for my son, who is almost 9, a few months ago. I would like to be able to block games, block content from other countries (just due to less monitoring), or even make my own “curated list” of games that I think are okay for him. And games shouldn’t be shown if they aren’t allowed... when I turn on account restrictions, he basically struggles to find much of anything to play and gets upset going from game to game only to find it won’t let him play. 

They really cater to kids and seem to be very driven by kids playing on the platform.  I wish they would take parental control settings seriously.",gx5jdbv

I tried account restrictions, but every game it recommends my son is restricted. It's too frustrating for him to click on game after game after game that was restricted.

When I saw a lot of the games it was recommending my 8-year-old, there is no way I would let him play without account restrictions (Squid Games, horror movies, etc.).

1) Roblox needs to only show games that can be played in recommendations and search when in curated mode. Or at a minimum only recommend games that can be played and in search clearly put an X and gray out the ones that are blocked.

2) Have an option to curate games, but allow chat with parent-approved friends.

3) Have an option to allow list and deny list additional games beyond what the account.

My ideal parental controls is that my child is only shown the games he is able to play, that are on the curated list, or approved by me. My ideal chat option is that my child can only chat with friends and that I control the friends list.

With the current account restrictions, my son was so frustrated with everything being blocked he uninstalled the game. He's tried talking me into allowing him to play without account restrictions, but there are inadequate parental controls without account restrictions and I have said no.",hqgk51b
