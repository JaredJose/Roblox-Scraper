My son is 5 and became really interested in Minecraft and Roblox after he downloaded it a few months ago while at his grandmothers house. I’ve learned to play both of the apps with him to understand it better & see the positives. They’re fun games, I admit. My issue is every time he has to put the tablet away, he has a meltdown. Every time. The duration of these meltdowns vary but it’s stressful for us both.  Tonight I thought about just getting rid of the tablet until weekends to avoid this but I think you all may have more productive advice. How should I approach these meltdowns and tablet time? 

Things I’ve tried: 
1. Giving him 1 hour per day which he can earn more time or lose time based on behavior and activities (this is new but I’m iffy on this method) 
2. Setting a timer so he can see how much he has and giving frequent updates + Having a transition activity (which he rejects) 
3. Letting him just play all day, no limits (this did not work at all obviously) 

He is starting school next month which I hope will help naturally but for now he is home all day while I work. Any advice, tips, things I’m clearly doing wrong? Can’t put every detail in this post so ask if you need clarification on anything.",t5_2qhn3,11,1.0

&#x200B;

Got a message from her teacher today; LO just turned 5 in January. Teacher said LO was stirring her yogurt but not eating it (not terribly surprising to me) but we do usually stir up the yogurt before eating it. Teacher assistant asked LO if she was done and LO smarted off to her. 

&#x200B;

Teacher also mentioned she hasn't been playing/speaking nicely with her friends lately. 

&#x200B;

LO has been suffering from upper respiratory stuff since forever, we had her on a medication that was supposed to help deal with the symptoms but there was some recent research out that said some kids may suffer from side effects - depressed mood, etc, so we took her off of it. We hadn't noticed TOO much but she has been defiant / rude to her grandmother, who is her usual caretaker during the week when we're working. 

&#x200B;

Her little brother recently turned 1.5, and has been a handful, so he's getting a lot of extra attention of course, because of the fact that he's a toddler. I'm sure that's playing into it. 

&#x200B;

To be 100% truthful, she gets too much screen time. YouTube - usually gaming channels and family vlogs, I haven't seen much of what she's watching that is directly objectionable - and her tablet/Roblox on the laptop.

&#x200B;

After discussing with her mom what we should do, we've decided that less screen time and some time devoted exclusively for her each day should help. Personally, I'm fine with 100% cutting her off from YouTube, and overall restricting her (and our, to be fair,) screen time down to a more reasonable level. It's hard with her little brother, but they're worth the effort. 

&#x200B;

Do you have any other suggestions to help out? Experiences?  Our overall plan is, as stated:

More dedicated one on one time for her

Less screen time overall

She is getting better about it, but it used to be really bad. She would sneak my daughter (Kylee 12) candy and treats and stuff her full of all of the junk food her little heart desires to the point it started effecting her health and anytime Kylee wanted something weather it be toys or staying up late and I told her no she could run to grandma and even though grandma knows I said no she would say yes. Sometimes when Kylee would get in trouble for misbehaving grandma would argue with me along with Kylee trying to defend her. 

I bought Kylee an iPhone for her birthday a few years back and wanted a debit card to put on file so she could down load certain apps. I told her she can't use my debit card because she is a child and I don't want any surprise charges on my phone so she goes and asks Grandma and Grandma said yes. I explained to grandma why this was a bad idea but she did not want to listen. 

  Kylee asked grandma if she could get a 10$ monthly subscription to an app using her card, I said no because grandma is on a fixed income and can't afford to pay monthly subscriptions but grandma says yes. This leads to extra charges and grandma having to call the bank and cancel her card. I tell her not to let Kylee add her card to her phone again but she doesn't listen. 

    Grandma let's Kylee add her card to her phone again although I told them both she is not allowed to do this, this time it leads to Kylee signing back up for the 10$ subscription with Grandma's permission and using grandma's card to buy Roblox also with Grandma's permission. Grandma forgets she allowed Roblox (about 50$ worth throughout the month some as a Christmas present) and didn't calculate it in her budget then comes up short on money at the end of the month and cancels her bank card gets refunded the money but has to wait for a new card. Accept for this time I make Kylee Pay back half of the money.

  Well last night not even two weeks after grandma got her new card in the mail I find out she let Kylee put her card on her iPhone again and let Kylee sign up for a free trial on her phone as long as she cancels the membership before her card is charged. Nobody said anything to me about this and now 40$ has been charged to grandma's card from apple because Kylee thinks you cancel a subscription if you delete the app she has no idea what she was doing so after the trial is up grandma gets changed for the subscription. After Kylee leaves to school grandma comes up to me and says she doesn't know how we are going to do this if she should make Kylee Pay for the whole thing or only half.

I caught him saying sexual stuffs such as “69” to his online friends and “I want to f*ck your mum” as his discord status… 

Seeing those messages has got me worried and got me curious on what led him to say such things… he likes to play games such as minecraft and roblox. He’s homeschooled-online schooling, so his friends who likes to play games has a discord server that they use to socialize and use while they’re playing… he also watches a lot of YT videos of gamers. Thinking abt those two factors has led me to assume that he might have picked up some bad content from some gamers (I sometimes overhear them saying bad words or trolling words that are inappropriate) or some of his friends might have said it. But of course, I’m not totally sure

I just want to know how is the best way I can talk to him about this as I don’t just plainly want to say that its bad or shame him about it or say that he’s young enough to understand because he does and has already an idea to it.

There are times when he studies and does chores so that's why I just don't mind him playing roblox and doing something he thinks fun during his couple hours of tablet time.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1016qo0/my_husband_thinks_our_daughter_is_terrified_of_me/,My husband thinks our daughter is terrified of me. I've never laid a hand on her...,Kittenknickers333,2023-01-02,1672645220.0,"We have a 5yo little girl with ADHD. She is not medicated. My husband travels for work so I'm left to parent alone 5 days out of the week, sometimes 6. That means I do all the fighting about homework, tooth brushing, bed time and so on. All alone. So far, the consequences of my husband's work has been that I am the bad cop and he the good. He comes in on Friday night with a patience cup full to the brim and therefore, very rarely runs out of patience when it comes to our daughters defiant behavior and big emotions. 

I deal with them as best I can, but obviously, I'm more worn down. Yes, I lose patience and get snippy. I have a tone of voice my daughter calls ""yelling"" and she gets upset when I use it. No I do not raise my voice unless she's across the house and can't hear me. 

Tonight was a Sunday on winter break so we spent the day in just playing games and relaxing. As per usual, my daughter asked me to play roblox with her. I said yes. 

As bed time ran nearer, my daughter began to get upset because I wasn't playing right. This is standard for when we play together. She's extremely controlling and also a sore loser, so if she's not blaming me for making her lose, she's mad at me for not playing like how she wants. When she started getting upset, I told her if she couldn't calm down we would have to stop playing. This is a regular consequence for when she starts having a tantrum. This made her upset and she ran to cry in the hallway. 

My experience with her told me to just leave her alone to work it out by herself. She's doing what I told her to do, calming down. If I try to talk to her while she's in this state, it tends to trigger an even larger tantrum. 

My husband came out of the bathroom and discovered her there. He asked her what was wrong and she told him. We were playing a game and she wanted me to play a certain way and I told her no, I play my way with my computer and she has my laptop to play her own way. We were still in the same game, still playing together, just different ways. My husband tried explaining that to her and she started screaming at the top of her lungs. That's when I decided it was bed time, we will not play if she's going to throw a fit. 

As always, my husband thinks he can handle it so he tells me to feed the dog while he talks to her. I go. When I come back, he has her tucked in bed and very angerly tells me we have to talk about ""how I deal with things"" 

At first he tells me that I have to control myself and not get angry because our daughter is upset. I told him I didn't feel angry because she was upset, i was frustrated. I didn't yell, but I did have a tone when I told her it was bedtime. 

I feel like it's pretty normal to be frustrated when a child is throwing a fit, my husband thinks it's abusive. 

He then told me that she said she was hungry. He told her he'd get her some food, and she said no because I'd be mad at her. The reason she said this is because the rule is no eating after brushing your teeth. We always have to fight her so hard most nights that it's not worth it to have her do it again. My husband came up with this rule himself but since he's not here 70% of the the time, I am the enforcer of that rule, and all rules. She had brushed her teeth and she knew I wouldn't approve of the food. 

I thought this was a normal child worry. No kid wants their parents to be mad. But my husband took this as evidence that my daughter who has never been screamed at or spanked or even slapped on the wrist, is terrified of me. I don't even give this kid time outs anymore! Not since she was 3 and we started suspecting her Adhd! I stick strictly to consequences. She would not have gotten in trouble for eating but yes, I'd get annoyed and make her brush her teeth again. 

I'm so hurt by what my husband said. He thinks that I shouldn't give her any consequences for getting angry at the games either. I should just let her feel her feeling and continue on like nothing happened, even if she screams at me, even if she knocks things off tables and rips up papers. I am to let her do it and because anger is a valid emotion. 

I'm floored, to say the least. I don't even know what to say. I'm here to get some validation that I'm not insane and that I'm not causing trauma to my daughter.",t5_2qhn3,31,0.89

Tldr since this got longer than expected. I think my son is acting up because I’ve had a baby, how can I help him? 

I have 2 kids my son is 8 and daughter is almost 5 months old. We’re on the waiting list to have my son assessed for autism so I do try to keep that in mind but his behaviour and attitude is becoming horrendous lately and I really don’t know what to do. He adores his baby sister and he wants to play/cuddle with her all the time but it’s too much. I can’t leave him alone in the same room as her anymore to even run to the toilet because he picks her up, I’ve explained to him so many times why he can’t do that and how dangerous it is but no matter what I say he’s convinced nothing bad will happen and it’ll be fine. He throws toys when he has a meltdown or swings them around when he’s playing usually close to the baby. When he does this I take away the toy until the next day but he’ll just pick up a different one and do the same. So then he has time out which is spent with him screaming and crying the entire time.

In the last 2 weeks he’s started waking her up, sometimes it’s an accident but it’s usually on purpose, literally every time she falls asleep or starts dozing off, i tell him why he can’t do that but he either completely ignores me and carries on or says sorry, stops for a little bit then starts up again like he’s forgot. He’s started bragging to other kids that he doesn’t listen to me (so he clearly knows what he’s doing is wrong), he argues about everything and anything possible, even when I agree with him about something he argues wtf? It’s so mentally draining.

I try to stay as calm as possible and talk it through with him but he ignores me or shouts at me that he knows but then still continues. I know it must be hard for him having a new baby in the house when it was just me and him for so long and it’s even harder since I’m ebf, so when baby is eating or sleeping I help him with his homework, we’ll play a board game or Roblox together (he’s not allowed to play online games unsupervised and it’s easier for me to know what’s going on if I’m in the game with him, I can see the chats). We do movies and snuggles, we’re reading the Harry Potter books together. I don’t know what else I could be doing to spend quality time with him so he doesn’t feel left out and I don’t know how to combat the behaviour and attitude. 

He goes to his dads most weekends and his dad tried to talk to him about this but had just as much luck as me. He has another sister (5) at dads and I recently found out that he’s hit and spat at her. This is beyond unacceptable and disgusting and I told son that when I heard about it. I honestly didn’t think he would ever do something like that. He’s always been so kind and sweet, I don’t recognise who he’s becoming. Any advice is more than welcome.",t5_2qhn3,3,0.81

We were watching a show together and he turned to me and said, ""Actually, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about."" So I turned the TV off and gave him my full attention because it sounded different than just a ""I did this cool thing at school/I played Roblox and../So and so said..."" etc. 

He said, ""I'm pretty sure I don't like girls, and I only like boys.""

I almost exploded with pride. He and I are very close, and it is something I have suspected about him for a very long time... I can't really say why, it is just a mothers intuition. But I've never told him as such. I've only taught him since he was old enough to understand, that everyone is free to love who ever they want to love. That families can look different than ours (a peaceful split with his dad when he was 3.5) ...some have two moms, some have two dads, some dads sadly passed away, some only have their mom to live with. 

What I was proud of was the fact that not only he felt comfortable being open enough to have that conversation with his parents (he told me he also had talked to his dad about it as well), but that he had the emotional intelligence to understand what he's feeling and to put it into words. 

I just smiled and thanked him for sharing that with me and that I'm proud of him for doing so. I did go on to say that he doesn't have to figure any of this stuff out right now, but am glad he is aware of how he's feeling at this point in time. I said, ""maybe you won't feel the same about it in a few years, and maybe you will feel like this and more! But no matter what, I'm just so proud that you're my kid and you can like who ever you want to like."" Then thanked him again for sharing that with me. He basically said, ""cool"", and we started watching our baking series again.

This is a staggering amount of information and freedom right at her fingertips. I did not gift it to her, but I also didn’t object outwardly so I’m as much to blame as anyone else. My daughter is exceptionally well behaved, a great friend and student. I honestly don’t worry about her as much as I would expect. She’s turning into a wonderful young woman. 

When asked if I snoop on her phone, I will admit to looking through her phone every once and a while to make sure she’s doing the right thing and not in danger.  Last night I looked through her phone for the first time in around a month and I found some things that are troubling. 

I found she sent a gif of anime characters touching a girls boobs to her friends, I found a video of Roblox characters humping each other and saying things like “ooh yea gimme more” (as an example), I also found her texting boys and girls making what I would call advances toward them. Advances like saying she likes them and thinks they’re cute/hot. She was rejected by one boy and said “ok I’m a lesbian now” and legitimately put rainbow ribbon in her hair and came out to me as a lesbian….(which if she is I of course stand beside her as her #1 fan and I made sure she knows that)

What I’ve found troubling also is that she is the only one of the kids she texts that’s doing things like this. When she does these inappropriate things she is overwhelmingly rejected and told to stop, but it doesn’t seem like she’s getting the message. 

Do I make it known I’ve seen these things on her phone? How do I approach this odd behavior?

For reference I’m a youngish single dad and figuring this parenting thing out as I go.

for some context, i live in Asia, people are generally nice, but there are some perks that are just off.

my 9Year old Daughter doesn;t even understand what ""to be considerate"" means.

as example her mother sleeps in the same room as her, she playing Roblox and voice chatting with some neighbor friends .. but she does it in a manner which makes impossible for her mother to sleep.

she isn't a bad girl or whatever, its just somethings people around here don't really do.  
like another example (adult) when i drive the car with more people in it, i choose the parking to ensure everyone gets out easy and maybe place the car in a direction where disavantaged passengers will have it more easy, this is somethings you will never see happening around here.

again its not bad people, just different culture. but i for once find the fact that people not considered at all in a country where the nicety of people is one of the things that makes them stand out for the rest of the world quite bad.

so the question here is, how do i teach my daughter to be considerate, without forcing it on her, and without having any support from the sourrounding society?",t5_2qhn3,2,1.0

My 9 year has always been a fairly easy child. Every step on my journey of being her mom has been easy. She’s always very respectful and well behaved, highest praises from every teacher she’s had, and very emotionally mature for her age. After I separated from my husband almost a year ago, I was convinced by family members to get her a phone for my safety as my husband had gotten physical with me before he moved out. My family was worried that if he ever showed up to try to hurt me no one would be around to help.

After getting her phone I started seeing little red flags here and there; she was always on FaceTime with her little group of friends and from what I was hearing they seemed like a bunch of little drama llamas. But I remember being her age and although I didn’t love it, I recognized that it was normal. I’ve never had any reason to not trust her. I had parental controls on her phone and since she is underage it was my Apple ID that was used on her phone, where my debit card is linked. She still needed me to enter my password to download apps and such so I always knew what she was up to. 

I’m a single mom to my two girls. We’re a one income household and I don’t get financial support from my STBX. I make $22/hr and it’s enough to pay the bills and necessities but there’s very little left for unnecessary expenses. I’m expecting a promotion with a much higher salary soon and I had a nice little cushion in my bank account from my Christmas bonus. For the first time in months I had more than a single digit number in my account on payday week. Things were looking hopeful. 

My brother sent $100 through Zelle for my daughter to buy Robux for Christmas and with my permission and help she’s been buying here and there. I was at work one day and she wanted to buy some and asked for my password so my mom could help her with it. As I said, great kid and no reason to not trust her. I reminded her how much money she had spent and how she had left to spend from her Christmas money.

Yesterday I went to pay my internet bill as it was shut off when I got home work. My card declined and I checked my bank account to see that I only had $45. I reviewed my transactions thinking that it was me who overspent. I saw $400 in charges for Robux over a week. I cried. 

She understands how electronic payments work. She knows she was spending from my bank account and she says she just got carried away. 

I took away her phone, permanently, and explained that in a few years we’ll try again because she shown over the last few months that she’s not ready for it and spending all my money was the final straw. I looked through her phone history to see if I could piece anything together in the situation and saw that she reset my Apple ID password and was Googling how to add Robux to a group fund. Apparently she was providing Robux the group she created with her friends. 

After seeing how calculated she was in this, I also canceled her 10th birthday celebration next month. I planned on taking her a few friends out to dinner and some activities. 

From everything I understand about discipline and consequences, I feel like the situation should be done now and I should let it go because she’s already received her consequences but it doesn’t feel done. I’m so angry and hurt. And I’m angry at myself too. I’m having such a hard time because I know that it’s not healthy to give the silent treatment or anything like that but I’m having such a hard time because I don’t really want to talk to her. 

How can I handle this in a healthy way?",t5_2qhn3,9,0.74

Her teacher said she's the best reader for her age she's literally ever known, by a long way. She's reading (silently to herself) for pleasure and can handle all the words thrown at her in general. She loves doing her maths for pleasure too and will write genuine stories (usually about princesses dying but hey...) for pleasure again. We'll just get presented with a 4 page book out of the blue, written with lovely handwriting etc.

Same time though, she LOVES TV, and found that her favourite thing is typically whatever comes up next on the YT Kids app on TV. This tends to be 12yr olds (and mid 30s women acting as if they're 12 yr olds) playing Minecraft and Roblox. She also likes a lady who paints old squishy toys, and also lots of colouring / drawing channels. Especially with the drawing she'll get pens and paper for herself and draw along, with lovely results. 

She used to love Ryan's World, but that and a few other ""Photogenic kids being exploited by their parents in a bizarrely empty and white house"" channels did quietly go on the block list.

She's just about to go to school as I type this. On school mornings she'll always have to eat, wash, dress before any TV at all, and when she does she always asks alexa to set a timer to go off after however she's told she can have... Weekends can be a bit more of a free-for-all though, as it's a good way for her to relax after a busy week of after school clubs etc.

So obviously... do you fellow parents think this is OK? There are (IMHO) good channels she likes, and other ones I feel are clearly awful. But then I'm some ancient dad who's just out of touch...? It feels like a shame she's watching poorly made, badly scripted clips rather than quality production values yet... eh... she likes it, and is clearly a bright shiny button of a kid.",t5_2qhn3,0,0.45

AS girl aged nearly 12 and a boy of 10 years old. They both like playing computer games. Especially the boy who would prefer to do nothing else all day.

We've limited their screen time to an acceptable amount, but I'm kind of worried about the kind of games he likes to play. The games he's been spending most of his time with in the last few weeks have been what I'd call lootbox simulators.

Pet simulator on Roblox is the most recent one. I've watched him play some and the core gameplay loop is, click on a box so your pets will destroy/open it. Coins come out and you can used the coins to buy eggs from which you get better pets, rolled on a random loot table. And then you go on to the next area where the boxes require more effort (AKA Better pets) to be opened and the cycle repeats.

I've got the feeling/suspicion that this game is doing nothing else but feed a basic dopamine loop not unlike a Skinner box and I'm worried that this is unhealthy for him.

I'm aware that games have gotten easier over time. When computers made it in to my life when I was a tween games were pretty brutal by today's standards, but this 'game' doesn't seem to offer any kind of challenge, just the gambling aspect of getting a superior, more rare pet from the eggs that you buy with the ingame currency\*.

His sister plays the game as well sometimes, but most of the time when she plays Roblox she spends her time roleplaying/playing pretend. Though because she does play, it's turning the game in to a contest for her younger brother, making him want to play even more.

Should I do something to stop him playing these kinds of games so much? And if so, what would be a good way?

&#x200B;

\*: You can use premium currency to buy better eggs, but that's something we don't allow and our kids know how freemium games use this mechanic to lure people in to constantly spending money.

**Edit:** I forgot to mention, in all his other media habits, TV, youtube, books he really favors the short and to the point stuff like grizzly and the lemmings (which is basically a modern wiley e coyote cartoon), let's play youtubers who hype up their reactions and books like 13-storey treehouse.

This strategy has proven to be great thus far because she always comes to us to ask questions, work through a hurtful or rude situation with friends, ask what certain things mean. Having the chance to have a conversation and teach her etiquette and social coping skills for the tech part of her life feels important in helping her navigate it at a later age, when stakes are higher and parents are not as involved.

This being said, she is one of a very few 5th graders who doesn’t have a phone. Most had them in 3rd and 4th grade. I’m not sure why this feels like a big next step but it does.

We live in Florida and the school was cancelled because the hurricane Ian was coming. My wife was at work and I was staying home with our kids 3(f) and 7(m). I put my daughter down for her nap and my son was playing Roblox on his phone ( I know I know). 
I started getting the place ready for the hurricane by ""nailing"" down anything that can fly and getting all of the garbage together to dispose of it. 
Now, we live in an apartment community and the garbage disposal is a 2 minute walk from our building. It's not a rare occasion that you would see cars with garbage bags on their hood driving by because the disposal is next to the entrance/exit of the community.
When I got all of the garbage/boxes together I asked my son if he wants to walk with me or to stay home. He chose to stay in. Not the the first time, although, up to about 6 months ago he was very apprehensive of staying home alone and would always chose the tagging along option.
So off I went and was gone for about 7 to 8 minutes. On a way back I get a phone call from him. His phone is fully functional and he has his own number.  He uses it to video chat with grandparents in NY or call mom at work (I work from home) and use mobile internet during trips. Before I could answer the phone call dropped. I called him back but the line was busy. 
I knew something was up so I ran home. It took me about 30 seconds after his call to get there.  When I made it, he was in tears and on a phone with someone, who, I was pretty sure, was my wife. 
He saw me walking in, said to whoever it was  that everything is fine now, bye and hung up. 
I asked him what happened and he said he thought I was missing. He said he needs to tell me something. I said sure. He said I thought it was an emergency and called 911. Sure enough his phone started ringing and it was a local police department calling back to make sure we are fine. The lady said she received a phone call from a child stating that his father was missing. I assured her that everything is fine indeed and I was only gone for 8 minutes taking a garbage out prior to hurricane hitting the area.
She said thank you for confirming and that was the end of it. 
But.. My son was in so much stress. He thought the police will come and take him away from us and place him with foster parents (his best friend's parents are going through a really bad divorce, that's where he gets his info from). I did my best to convince him it is not going to happen unless he will continue calling the police every time I'm gone for less than 10 minutes. Obviously, I'm not going to leave him home alone again, even if he begs me to. 
We had a long conversation about what real emergencies are and when it's a good call to get the police involved. 
He was shaken for about 40 minutes or so after it happened and then went to his usual self. He brought it up again when my wife came home and we went through what the emergency situations are again. 
He truly believed it was an emergency and I was lost or something, that is why he made a call.

I blame Roblox:)). He might have lost the track of time playing his rainbow friends game.

For context - we never left our kids home alone. Not a single time. Cleaning outside or walking a dog, if they don't want to join but can still see us,  is the only time when they are inside by ""themselves"". 

Anyway, I would love if you could share similar incidents and how you handled them. 


Tldr: My kid called the police while I was taking the garbage out and he thought I was gone missing. It all happened within 8 minutes span.

Ps. I see that some of you have different opinion whether or not my son should have a fully functional phone. I want to make it clear that I see no harm in him using his phone and play some games on it. He gets about an hour of game time per day. He may still use his phone for other tasks, like reading, math, drawing etc.
All of it is easily controlled through parents app and phone settings. 
When I said I was blaming Roblox for what happened - I was making a joke.
I'm not taking his phone away from him.

I stepped in, and asked done questions- no, he didn't know the person, yes it was totally free- about $15 worth. 
We then had a talk (again) about how one should NEVER accept any gifts from strangers, or reveal personal information, etc.  

This has never been an issue with his older siblings, however I could see his eyes glaze over during our talk- the cost-benefit equation was just too skewed towards him (I think) in his brain that there will be very little incentive for him NOT to engage in something like this again. His world has just been too safe- not exactly sheltered, but he's never really seen or experienced real danger.

I'm not sure where to go with this...

Edit: we've had many conversations about internet safety, about nothing is ever free, but he has always been our...(greediest sounds mean, but...) child. He just doesn't think too deeply if there's something immediately in it for him.",t5_2qhn3,3,1.0

She has always slept next to me and my bf’s bed since she was born. Her crib then now bed has always been next to us just b/c of living arrangements in his parents house. They refurbished the basement where is now an open area. With the stairs split in the middle. We took one side and made the other area for her, like her own little bedroom where she has her clothes, kitchen set and other toys. She didn’t like the idea of sleeping away from us but I’d figure now is the time for her to learn to sleep on our own, without us right next to her. The problem now is, around I’d say 4 or 5 months ago we have started noticing every single sound scares her. And I mean every single sound. He doesn’t like the dark, needs to see every thing and needs to know what every single noise is. I think it’s due to my bf’s mom no regulating what she watching on her phone (my daughter does have her own iPad, but goes for her phone more because she knows she can do whatever she wants on it. She plays Roblox and watches YouTube clips of whatever is on it. We have tried to tell his mom, she needs to regulate what she’s doing on her phone but she doesn’t quite care. She is who watches her while both of us work during the day. ) i think Roblox has basically made her scared of noises because of all the scary games there are on it. I refuse to have her sleep on our bed because she needs to learn to sleep in her own bed. There has been nights where I have just given in because we’ve just been so exhausted. There was a night where we both called out of work because we got 0 sleep. I honestly don’t know what to do or how to approach this or how to fix it. I’ve recently started giving her kids melatonin to ease her into sleep but she still manages to wake up and not go back to bed easily.

He's been asking for one for months, especially after the schools sent all the kids home and he barely saw any of his friends from school.  He has had trouble making friends (in general) because he's a little shy in person, but he's such a sweet, nice, kid.  I was counting on this year being his turning point because he's really coming out of his shell with a lot of things.

We relented this October and got him the headset/mic for his birthday for his (my) Xbox.  I figured it would be a good way for him to be social with other kids.  I only allow him to play age-appropriate games, and I made him sign a written contract like a lunatic the day he got these.  It was a basic contract that he read and understood, including to not use adult language, not to talk to anyone much older than him, and and I reserve the right at any time to take it away if the rules aren't respected.  I had full confidence in him because I know he's a good kid.

He has respected the rules and not broken the contract.  But he doesn't STFU!!!  He's talking to kids non-stop in the hour he is allowed to play.  He lost two friends today because they were probably so freaking annoyed from him talking at them for an hour straight.

If your son or daughter has complained that some friend online won't STFU, that was my kid, sorry.  When he was little, he didn't speak much and we wondered if he would ever talk.  Now it's just constant, absolutely relentless talking.  I know I will miss this one day, but christ man aren't you thirsty for talking for an hour straight like that?

My 8 year old daughter loves Roblox and she used to get screentime to call her friends and play together on her iPad.  Over a week ago, I noticed I got locked out of my Amazon account and when I checked my email to get back into my account, there were hundreds of dollars of suspicious charges.  The customer service rep confirmed it was Roblox and it took over an hour over the phone but luckily they refunded it all.  They said it can be tricky to get refunded.

My daughter had her iPad taken away and wasn't allowed to talk to friends for a week.  I was under the impression that her iPad wasn't in Kid Mode and that must've allowed the purchases because in four years she had never bought anything before.

Today after a talk and promises to never ever do that again, I gave her the iPad back, with Kid Mode on.  Sure enough though, I was going through my email and I found a ton of purchases again, only a couple of hours after she got it back.  I was furious, we had another long conversation about how wrong it is to steal from mom and how disappointed and disgusted I am and I said that her iPad is gone indefinitely.  I'll have to call Amazon in the morning AGAIN to hopefully get that money back too because I'm broke.  Long story short I quit my job to care for my terminally ill mother and I haven't found anything remote yet, so I only have a couple hundred dollars in my checking as it is.  I'm fucked if Amazon doesn't refund me.

She was told there would again be no friends, no TV or anything fun tomorrow especially, just working with me outside or doing cleaning around the house.  I feel like I don't know how to make it sink in, or what to say to make her understand.  I never would've dreamed of doing this to my parents, and she looked ashamed but I feel like I don't know if she gets it.  Hell, I question if she's just so short-sighted that she didn't think there'd be any consequences or if she just doesn't respect me because she ignored everything we had just talked about.

Is there something I'm missing to make her understand?  I tried to explain that when she buys things online with my card, it's the same thing as reaching in my wallet and pulling out money.  I'm just not sure if it's not a serious enough consequence or if I need to focus more on how I discuss it with her to make her realize her wrongs.  I worry that she's not afraid of consequences or doesn't care enough about them which tells me that maybe I'm missing the mark and not getting through to her.  Is there something else I should add for a punishment?  Is there more I should add to the discussion?  I was flustered so I didn't ask about why she did it, just focused on how it felt to have her do that to me for a second time.  Honestly I don't know if the 'why' matters, I'm just hurt, afraid I can't get that money back, and feeling like I don't have my kid's respect.

TL;DR: My daughter made in-game purchases on my card, was punished, and immediately did it a second time when she got it back.  Not sure if my punishments or discussions are enough to make her change her behavior and understand how terrible stealing is.  How can I help her understand how serious this is and be sure she respects me?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the responses and suggestions.  Roblox is gone for sure.  I will continue my discussion with money and I will have her earn the money back.  I will say that after the first time I changed up the passwords, made sure that she couldn't get into my account without a second different password and I had assumed that without my adult account she couldn't make any purchases because the older iPad she had would always block purchases unless I logged in.  

I've gone through the game with her before and there are a lot of ads and in-game purchases, but she pointed them out to me and said, ""You have to buy those so don't click on them.""  So naively I thought she knew to never buy anything as this was long before the problem began.  I will talk to her more about the 'why' again, because I know she likes to video chat her friends and she might have felt pressured to buy that.",t5_2qhn3,270,0.92

There was so much disappointment with cancelled birthday parties, sports, camps etc. that we became lenient on the issue of Robux. Before COVID we never permitted the boys to have them. One way my two boys, currently ages 11 and 8, were able to have a social life then was by playing Roblox over zoom with their friends. The friends were all getting Robux to spend on micro transactions and so they started begging and begging for them. I gave in because it was the only thing that I could provide that wasn't getting canceled. We still limited receiving Robux to gift cards they got for special occasions or things that they could earn through chores or good behavior. We did explain at the time that this was a special thing and not typical and that we did not support giving money to these games through microtransactions in a way that could result in addiction. Obviously we knew that our kids didn't fully understand this but we were trying to plant to see that microtransactions were not healthy and generally were not necessary to enjoy a game. My older son totally understands and even calls it a scam. My younger son does not understand and it has become a big source of tension as he relentlessly begs for Robux to buy upgrades to the equipment he uses in the games. He throws fits about it and obsesses. He will beg for weeks at a time and not let it go. We have tried to reason with him. We have explained to him in child appropriate language how microtransactions work. We have talked to him about the psychology of marketing. We have added up all the money he has spent on Robux (mostly from gift cards he's gotten for birthdays and Christmas) to show to him that it's not just a dollar here or a dollar there. These approaches are not working and he is just fixated on spending Robux to buy these upgrades. I had intended to continue to let the boys still receive Robux gift cards for special occasions that they could have total control over in order for them to learn how to manage their own spending, but I'm now wondering if instead my youngest son is growing addicted through the dopamine hits he gets by buying the upgraded virtual equipment in these games. I'm looking for any thoughts on this issue, but would love to hear if anybody has found child appropriate resources to help kids understand how microtransactions work and how he is potentially being set up for a lifetime of not being able to resist the psychology of the instant purchase.

Not in a depressed way, just matter-of-fact in response to us asking if he wanted to invite friends for his birthday.

He's on the autism spectrum but is very bright and enjoys things that a neurotypical ten-year-old does: Minecraft/Roblox, Mario (and video games generally), minions, funny cat videos, explosions and action movies and fart jokes, etc. He's a possibly a little more non-sequitur about his interests than maybe the average kid would be,  but he's not fixated and he can go with the flow.

His biggest obvious marker is a speech impediment -- he pretty obviously doesn't say his Rs correctly, and it's severe enough that even I sometimes need him to repeat himself or enunciate more clearly, but he speaks fluently and uses age-appropriate vocabulary, etc. I'm sure this is an obstacle for socialization, but he's in speech therapy and is working on it -- he's made a lot of improvements, and the R thing is the big one that he's working on now.

He'll independently talk to other kids and even join in with them if they're playing a game, but a lot of times he's just doing his own thing -- if we take him to the park he'll sometimes play tag with other kids, but other times he'll just climb on the net or swing on the zipline by himself, or whatever. When he does interact with other kids he's friendly and polite and helpful, good about taking turns, etc, so I know it's not that he's hard to get along with.

But I don't know how to help him make friends. We live in a neighborhood where most of the kids are much older or younger. We also have be a 7-year-old daughter, and we set up play dates for her with our friends' kids (and we include our son in those, too, but sometimes he isn't interested in playing with 7-year-old girls), but nobody we know has a son around his age. There's a neighbor girl who is in his class at school and we spend time with their family (they also have a 6-year-old son) and our kids get along (e.g., they're excited to get together and play video games, or play games, or go to the park together), but at 10 boys and girls typically don't want to be close friends, even if they get along well (plus, I can tell that the neighbor girl likes our son well enough but doesn't see him as a close friend).

He's not very athletic, although we put him in stuff like swimming lessons and karate and golf camp and he enjoys those well enough, and gets along with the other kids but there's usually an age gap. Also, he has a hard time with repeated defeat and frustration and is a bit more timid than other kids when it comes to physical risk, and he hasn't really expressed interest even when asked, so we haven't signed him up for team sports. We put him in other group activities like robot camp and French class, and he has fun in those, but they usually but very long and usually have a wider age range, too.

We've spoken to his teacher and school counselor, and his teacher says he's friendly and happy in class and gets along with the other kids, but at recess and such tend to spend time by himself. The counselor added a goal to his IEP to improve social relationships, but I'm unclear how that's happening and he's obviously still mostly a loner.

My heart breaks for him. He's such a great kid, but between the autism and the pandemic lockdowns he hasn't learned to make friends, and there haven't been any organic opportunities among our friends group or in the neighborhood, so most of his socialization is at school. He's so smart and capable and has made so much progress in so many areas of his life, but I worry for his future if he's unable to find a friend group.",t5_2qhn3,43,1.0

I told her I was waiting weeks to watch stranger things and it came out. She said we could go to the theaters and I said I didn't want to see minions 2. I suggested other things, but she didn't want to see anything else, just minions 2. After they got tickets, my friend called and asked if I could go to my friend who passed away's burial. I said yes and was glad I didn't get tickets for the movie. I told my daughter about who died and my wife tried to interject and I ignored her and told my daughter and told her where I was going instead of the movie. Then my wife went out the movies with her. After the movie was done, I tried calling because it was my friend's child's birthday and even though we went to a burial we were still trying to celebrate the birthday and my friend wanted my wife and daughter to come by. She never answered the phone or responded to my texts. The next day she just randomly came home. The mutual friend we have was a woman, so this wasn't about cheating, she was angry I didn't make the day a family day. But today she did the same thing, took our daughter out and wasn't answering my calls or texts. They are about to take a trip out of country, and I was supposed to go, but I feel like I'm just being used and she just wants me there just to show she has a husband (edit: as in to keep up appearances), not because she actually wants me there, and considering what she did with this whole taking daughter out and not telling me where was my final decision on if I was going with them.

Hopefully that extra part clears up the why she did it, but regardless of why, I don't think it's right. I told her she can go wherever she wants and doesn't have to tell me, but if she takes our child, I need to know where our child is to put my mind at ease and in case anything happens I can know where they were.",t5_2qhn3,312,0.95
https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/y6i20g/an_emerging_success_story/,An Emerging Success Story,incredulousbastahd,2022-10-17,1666029974.0,"Quick description of our scenario:

I'm a 38 year old father. Had two kids from a previous marriage that are now 15 & 13. My girl moved in with her two kids at the very beginning of covid shortly after we had a baby, who is now 2 and a half. Her two previous kids are 10 (boy) and 8 (girl). Their father is basically a non factor -- something I thought would change as he's gotten older and figured things out. Wrong. He sadly still does nothing for his kids. So their mom had basically been raising them with her mom and step dad, who provided a solid foundation, but instilled 0 discipline...something I quickly came to find out shortly after they moved in

When we decided to move in together, I knew there were going to be issues, but it turned out they were a bit deeper than expected. It became clear her kids absolutely ran over their mother in what I would consider extreme ways -- a bit shocking to me at first. We'd been together for 3 years at that point, and while I hadn't spent the most amount of time with her kids, I thought I had a decent feel for them as people: typical spoiled 8 & 6 year olds, not too unlike my own at those ages. Not correct. The extreme tantrums would last 15-30 minutes at a time until they got what they wanted -- to the point the boy would threaten to kill his mom: An 8 year old threatening to kill his mom in extreme anger was a weekly occurrence. I was constantly picking my jaw up off the floor the first 6 months they lived here, with little idea of what to do to solve this problem

Four or five months in to our new living situation, I had had enough. Something had to change. I sat my gf down, and told her her children's behavior was unacceptable, and this can't go on. She agreed, and we decided to make some changes. Come to find out, she was actually scared of her 8 year old son, and wasn't sure if he was displaying psychopathic tendencies. I chuckled and even though some of the behaviors were very concerning, this was not my take on the matter

Over the course of the first 3-5 months, I simply observed how she dealt with them on a moment to moment basis or when they needed some guidance/her foot to come down. To put it simply, it just never happened until she had had enough emotional abuse, and then she'd blow up. To me, it was apparent this was the first thing that needed to change, but the hardest thing for her to hear. She felt guilty about their father not being there for them and so felt the need to continually do everything for them while put up with their constant shit...again until she snapped, then become guilty for getting mad and would console them after she blew up. It's her nature. She's not a loud and overbearing person. She's small and relatively quiet. A bit of a pushover in all honesty

Ultimately, I'm an incentives guy so we agreed on a couple principles:

1. Mom needed to be more consistent
2. We'd instill some notion of negative and positive consequences based on their behavior

We first began limiting video games when behaviors got out of control. This worked relatively quickly with the girl. Her 25 minute tantrums reduced to 2 or not at all. Almost completely cooperative, with rare exception

Not the same for the boy. Immediate explosion. This definitely caused a snowball effect in his behavior. The tantrums got worse, his extreme anger turned to nonchalant f you attitude, and he turned to sneaking and lying, which in turn caused consequences to become harsher and longer. The fighting between all of us skyrocketed. We tried everything from taking away video games, taking away tv, writing sentences, chores, extra chores, and grounding. None of this had any significant impact. This turned into a year of constant, never ending shit between the boy, myself, and the mom. Not only that, but the boy began sneaking devices and anytime he did that would stay up literally all night. He would be so tired he wouldn't go to school. This would happen if not daily, multiple times per week

So a couple months ago, we started looking at how he was being dealt with: still inconsistency, delayed consequences weren't having an impact, and looking at why he was sneaking devices. We came to the conclusion that consequences that were difficult to enforce were not working and were often too long, mom constantly doing things for him that he can do himself was not in his best interest, and we felt he had an addiction -- not necessarily to video games but certain, easy-win Roblox games that basically gamify the child's attention, something I'd warn all parents about. I'm not anti-video games in the slightest, but these 3rd party Roblox games that mine young kids' attention and desire for robux (Roblox money) clearly can become addictive for an impressionable young mind

So, rather than long lasting and delayed consequences, we shifted to a few things:

1. Immediate corner time for bad behavior (5, 10, 15, 30 minutes at a time). No delayed consequences eg have to write 30 sentences ""I will not cuss at my mom"" or something before getting tv back, etc. That's gone
2. We implemented a  two hour window where he had to do something productive for himself before watching tv. Still no video games. We give some structure for the time, but he can choose what he wants to do for himself
3. Turned wifi off for all devices at certain times so even if he sneaks something, he'd be shit out luck for playing the Roblox games all night long
4. Say no to him whenever he asked for help for anything he can do for himself
5. Implemented a much earlier bed time so he can begin going to sleep earlier
6. If he gets scared at night and can't sleep (a common occurrence), to explicitly not sneak, he can wake me up anytime, and we'll figure out how to help him get to sleep

At first, of course there was whining about the two hours of constructive time, but over the course of a couple weeks, he began getting pretty good at drawing!  He'd go outside a bit more, play with the baby, kick the ball around, and he'd be more helpful with things we asked him to do. While he still can't help himself with some of the sneakyness when a device has been left out, most of the time, he's been able to get to sleep before 10pm. And he's come to us when he gets scared, instead of choosing to take a device and stay up all night. His attitude has changed dramatically -- to the point we haven't had a blow up fight in weeks. Win, win, win, win

Yesterday, I gave him back time with the Xbox for the second time in about 6 months or so. He deserves it. His attitude has improved to a point I'd call his behavior ""normal,"" and he seems to have turned a corner with the extreme anger/tantrums -- it's been weeks or longer. We'll see how he behaves now that he had a good chunk of time with the Xbox, and I plan on letting him have some time today once he's done the things he needs to do. But I'm proud of him, and so is his mom. We feel successful in our efforts, and I thought it was worth noting  and celebrating. Let's hope it keeps up",t5_2qhn3,20,0.92

When Covid came about, my college switched to online only, and his babysitter quit on me. I'm a single mom, and no one in the family would help me, or watch him for me (Okay fair, whatever I guess). At the same time, when school made the online switch, my professors all of a sudden decided that busy work was the way to go. So needless to say, if I wanted to pass I had to find a way to make it happen. 

I was 100% against too much screen time and this boy had TONS of toys and things he could interact with. His main thing has always been my attention though, so he made it impossible to do any schooling, he's never played well by himself. 

He took an immediate liking to the tablet though (because it's like crack to children). Fast forward two yesrs later to today, and now it seems worse. He's either all up in his tablet or all up in my face. There's no in between. He doesn't really play with his toys at all anymore, and he sits there and asks me a million questions a minute about his new obsession he's learned about from his tablet. He's obsessed with Roblox (which is literally the most nerve-wracking thing on the planet to me). If I'm trying to clean, cook, or anything and he doesn't have his tablet he will sit there and purposefully get in my way, or whine until he gets my full, undivided attention.

I feel as if this isn't something a 4-year old is supposed to do (because I was also an only child and I WANTED to play alone and be left-alone to play and be by myself). I feel like the tablet has caused behavioral issues as well. I'm at a loss, and I have no idea what to do.",t5_2qhn3,12,0.88

I have an 11 year old son with ADHD. It's been difficult to say the least. Right now I don't want to have a drink, or get high and forget about all my problems. I just want to do what I have to to make sure my son thrives in this world. But it's so hard. And my best just isn't good enough. I stress constantly about the quality of life he will grow into. 

Nothing motivates him. Not rewards or punishment. I don't believe in hitting kids. But my patience is constantly being put to the test. 

He has a issue with keeping his room clean and I told him he had to straighten up or he would get bugs. And he had to put all his dishes away in the kitchen. We went back and forth about it because he wanted me to do it for him and said I had no reason not to. I turned off his console and he got really upset and swatted a bowl to the ground and was yelling at me. He got in trouble and I sent him to bed early. Most recently we have had to deal with him losing control of his emotions. In school he got into a tussle with another student because the other student broke something of his. (From what he described it was a toy or something) but i don't think it was the whole story because other boys were involved and he didn't tell me how. 

That same day while he was at school I looked at his YouTube account and saw he was on his phone at all hours, Sometimes 3 and 4 am, and last week he started making comments cursing at people saying things like ""That S is Fing gay"" and things of that nature. He also has mentioned Andrew Tate. Which was really concerning for me. I have told him to stay away from that content and why it's wrong. 

I took away his phone (except during school hours since he doesn't use it there) and allowed him to at least call his friend on the weekend. I also put some more secure parental locks and restrictions on his phone. That was last week. And now today, I come into his room and someone starts yelling over and over again, horrible words, every bad word you can think of. The N word (hard ER) Sh*t, fu*k, b*tch. Just saying them over and over again. Apparently it's someone his friend from school knows. And when I asked him why didn't he just leave the room? He said it's none of his business, ""why do I care, I'm not his dad"". I asked if this happens all the time and he said yes. I sat him down and I explained to him why I was upset and it was the last straw and I was going to have to really make some changes. 

So far I have been trying gentle parenting. His punishments so far have been doing things like writing in a journal (which he hates doing because it's boring) and spending more time with his family. Doing his own laundry. When he is done with his chores, I say he can still play on his PlayStation but I limit it to 2 hours on weekdays. 

Video games is the one thing he really likes to do. I'm currently trying to find him some activities like tournaments he can train and participate in and maybe videogame testing for cash. He also started a YouTube page, I help him with edits and even make some of my own for his page, and I'm researching some streaming equipment to gift him for Christmas (but after the incident I said he had to cool it for a while on YouTube) and while I don't agree or like the constant focus on video games, I don't want to squander his passions and I do what I can to encourage him. And I thought it wasn't hurting him. But now I'm not so sure. 

So I told him that I was at the end of my rope and this is my last resort and after I told him no phone and no PS5 until his He started yelling and screaming, he was clearly having a panic attack. I tried to calm myself down, calm him down, offered him cold water and breathing exercises, he was really defiant he just lost control. I tried to call his dad but he got even more upset. He was crying and yelling and screaming and hitting the chair (which I told him not to do) saying ""why me?"" ""I should of done so and so"" crying and saying he just wanted to play Roblox with one of his other friends (they have been online friends for some years, I'm actually planning a trip so they can finally meet, my son thinks of him as his brother) I even told him he can have one more night but tomorrow thing are going to change. He couldn't accept that. He kept crying, hyperventilating, begging me not to take his phone or his PS. 

I understand his has ADHD (he does take medication, but I'm going to call his dr and see if we can explore getting it readjusted, I'm thinking with him going through puberty and hormones it might not be enough anymore. He just can't focus) I know all that comes with it includes a low frustration tolerance, difficultly with hygiene (I'm not sure he probably bathes himself. Sometimes he just sits in the shower) and lack of motivation (I'm not sure if it's the right way to say that but i have read it's hard for people with ADHD to focus on goals and achieve them) but it's not really an option to just give up on teaching him. While I do have help I struggle to find a stable income. Getting him involved in activities like kids football or karate cost money that I can't really afford to spend right now. (I'm saving for trade school) and I don't really know how else to keep him occupied at home without him complaining about being bored to tears. 
I know it will all come with time but I'm still scared for the future. What if he doesn't get it? What if he hurts someone? What if he loses his temper at the wrong time with the wrong person and ends up dead or in jail? And as a black young adult everyone knows the statistics there. 

When I tell you I want to cry right now but I still feel so numb. I don't know what else to really do. While forcing him to do anything seems wrong I know that I can't do nothing. I will say I never wanted to be a parent and this is why. Raising humans is not easy at all. Raising disabled black boys is even harder. One hand people say ""his mama should of whooped his ass"" and the other says ""boys need love and consideration"" and you can't really do both. 

I believe I also have ADHD and I don't know how I would have wanted to be parented in this type of situation. I don't want him to hate me but I'm slowly accepting that no matter what I do or how I do it I'm going to be the villain. I am really dreading the teenaged years.

So we seem to have inadvertently adopted my kid's ""girlfriend"".  She came over this weekend and never really left: they played Roblox and video games, sometimes they watched the toddler while I did the laundry or the dishes. This weekend was my toddler's birthday so we invited her to come to the zoo with us (my kid has always been allowed to bring a friend, as he's well beyond the ""let's put the rocks down and look at the monkey"" phase) and somehow that morphed into a sleepover and then she fell asleep on our couch again for the third time in two days and by the time I sent her home she'd spent 30 hours with us. Even our dog has stopped growling at her, and if you know our dog, you know that's a big thing.

And I kinda had the impression that she still did not want to go home.  I wouldn't have a problem with letting her stay longer if we'd arranged it with her parents, but our agreement was for this one night.  But I also suspect that we're dealing with a situation that's in that gray zone between ""different parents, parenting differently"" and some level of neglect.  I'm not the motherly type. I'm not the type to sit down with a plate of cookies and talk about life or gossip away even in English; in the local language it's even harder. How do I make sure this kid is okay?",t5_2qhn3,14,0.86

As he is getting older pokemon go has been my new clutch. Not that he isn't still playing outside a lot but games just seem to be more of a motivator. I feel like the time I used playing outside was a vital part of my upbringing. So that leads me to where I am now, with 2 solutions: Number 1 is I have been finding ""cool"" active toys and games for the outside spikeball and wavebord has been a great success for having a good balance not getting to ""kid"" and still being active.

Number 2 is the reason I'm writing here looking at active games and other active digital experiences. I would love it if any of you guys have some active gaming alternatives that I don't know of. Looking for motivator to replace just some of the ""Fortnite time"".

This is my current list sorted by my requirement (having a small living room):

Wii: The best indoor way to give him an alternative to Fortnight and Roblox

Switch: for one Fortnight and Minecraft are kings on the switch and I did buy Ring Fit Adventures but the game felt more like a chore and fell out of favor fast. Also, have to Switch Sports and it is a mixed bag dependent on who is playing and how much energy me and Daniel have.

Bought a lot of promising products:

Playfinity ball: Was cool in the start and if your kid loves throwing and catching a ball you might have a better result, but Daniel got bored after a couple of weeks.

WRDLS ball: This was the biggest letdown loved the concept but the delivery was really bad. The games were both buggy, unfinished, and not fun

UDU Console: This is the latest project I backed. The game's graphics look a bit shit in my opinion, but the concept seems interesting at least. If it delivers it also seems like a cool piece of hardware.

Also looked at other pokemon go like games (Daniel loves RPG like games):

The Witcher: Monster Slayer: was a bit realistic in the graphics and couldn't and just worse than pokemon go

Orna: Orna is a great time sink for anyone who likes RPG, but it is a slow and stats-heavy RPG. We played it together for a couple of months and will still pick it up at times

VR: I would love to have VR but it is a bit too expensive and I don't have the space for it

He has a group of friends (all his grade, about 5-6 of them, a couple of girls included) that he feels SO close with the past six months or so. Lately he has been more hermit-like... hiding out in his room on calls/FaceTimes with his friends, playing video games like Roblox and Fortnite. I had chalked up his newfound ""independence"" to typical maturing... however, my husband and I keep a pretty close eye on what he's saying in chats (texts/messages via Messenger Kids) and we've noticed that a specific 2 or 3 of the friends send messages with inappropriate language in them, as well as screen-sharing inappropriate videos (no nudity or anything overtly graphic, but a lot of implied sexuality). The couple of times I've witnessed my son watching their screen shares, I've told him it's time to get off the call, and he immediately hangs up.

They have 1 boy (6) and I have 3 boys (3, 7, 12). 
My 12 and my 7 year old like horror games. Nothing crazy - think Poppy Playtime and Five Nights at Freddy’s. 
Their son is autistic - doesn’t like scary things and has nightmares. 
My kids try hard to be considerate of this by not allowing him to watch and my 7 year old even keeps his scarier plush toys at his fathers home instead of mine. Sometimes their son try to get my 7 year old to let him watch and he’s pretty adamant about not letting him see or says why don’t we play something less scary on Roblox. 
My kids don’t have nightmares and they know that these things aren’t real and it’s just for fun. My oldest once wanted to watch the Conjuring and got scared and said nope this is freaking me out so we turned it off. I don’t make them watch/play scary things and there is plenty off limits and if I felt these games were messing with them I’d for sure ban them as well. 
Anyways, his ex has been upset saying that I’m a bad parent and disgusting person because I allow my kids to play these games. It’s pretty hurtful even though I feel like I understand my children’s feeling and if it was affecting them negatively I’d act accordingly. And we do everything we can to accommodate the comfort of their child who feels things differently and I totally get that. 
She’s even made digs while I was at her home saying what kind of awful people let their kids play this stuff, knowing damn well I do. 
The thing I don’t get is she allows him to play stuff like Among Us, which you literally kill people and and try to lie your way out of getting caught, which seems just as bad to me. There is actual depiction of being shot, eaten, or chopped in half too. And Poppy Playtime (the one she really seems to hate) is more about chasing/jump scares, more tension based same with FNAF but somehow they are worse. No blood or gore. 
Anyways, I’m down for brutal opinions. Do you guys think it’s terrible to let my kids play or watch other kids play these? Should I have a discussion about this with her to try to ease her mind? Or just continue to do my best and keep to my own like I’ve been doing? I guess it’s just rough having mean words hurled at you but wanting to keep the peace. And to be clear I respect her decision as a parent to not allow her son to play these, she knows him better than I do and I will always do everything in my power to respect her choices as a parent.

The few times my daughter has hung out with L, things have gone missing and it turned out L stole them.  When she tried to resolve it, she didn’t get anywhere so I had to contact L’s mom to ask if she had seen said items. Of course this was all just “a big misunderstanding” and L can do no wrong, all three times. Whatever, I just told my daughter not to go into L’s house with her stuff or bring anything she values out to play- keep it at home. 

Many of the kids say L is sweet to parents’ faces and rude behind their backs which I called almost immediately after meeting her but they’re kids so they’re all growing and learning- I didn’t write her off, just kept an eye/ear out when she was here.

Anyway, E and L have teamed up now as besties and there is consistent drama when they are around. My daughter is not perfect by any means and I call her out when I see something she’s done or said that shouldn’t be but it seems they pick on her more often than not. One of the recent issues was stolen roblox pets 🙄 which taught my daughter a lesson not to share her login with anyone. Now there is a whole Snapchat problem (why any of these kids have Snapchat is beyond me- my daughter is not allowed social media and has had her phone taken away each time she tries to sneak it). 

Apparently E and L logged into my daughters old Snapchat account (same login info) from when she snuck it before and sent rude messages to themselves, then texted my daughter asking why she said that. I know it couldn’t have been my daughter because the messages are time stamped and I had already had her turn in the screens by that time. 

I don’t want to bring it up with the parents again because they clearly let their idea of their kids cloud reality and it’s a dead end, we seem to have very different parenting styles re boundaries, accountability, etc.. but basically my question is how do I tactfully keep my child from playing with them and should I? She is very social and just desperately wants to hang out with friends and be around others but ends up doing so at her detriment out of convenience and wanting to belong. I don’t want it to be awkward with the neighbors but also don’t want to see my sweet girl get shit on by a pair of mean girls. 

If you read this far, thanks!

I love gaming and have loved it since I was 5. Both me and my husband play alot of PC games, (Monster hunter, souls games, overwatch etc). We also have a 2 year old. I'm afraid that if my child grows up and sees that I'm into video games it will affect her in a... negative sort of way like she might not be focused on studying etc. since her mom plays games and she'd end up having a video game addiction idk lol. I only play when she's asleep but our house is a geek's heaven with different consoles and PCs, name it we have it.

I just feel like moms should only be baking, cooking, reading books, doing arts and crafts and being all motherly (like my mom) and not gaming or playing drums or building gundam kits or listening to heavy metalmusic. I guess my question is, are there moms here that share similar interests but their kids turned out... y'know, okay? Lol I know it's weird but since being a mom I've been lost, not knowing if I should give up my passions and just have typical mom hobbies.

EDIT: So many great replies, eye opening ones too. Thank you!!! I am relieved. All the stories of families gaming together made me excited to play with my daughter. And I won't lose my passion and what makes me who I am!!!",t5_2qhn3,519,0.93
