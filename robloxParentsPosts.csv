This seems entirely unreasonable.  The over 13 under 13 setting does little to nothing.  The “allow only curated content” still shows ALL of the user generated content simply with an x over the play sign.  So the child can still see everything they can’t play, gets frustrated about it as they seek curated content, and can’t talk with friends.  

The “all or nothing” approach to safety and security for children feels more like mere lip service to parents who are trying to monitor their children’s internet time.  A 9 or 10 year old wants to play roblox so they can chat with their friends.  Prohibiting this defeats the purpose of the entire platform and really prohibits the child from effectively playing many of the games which require some level of communication.  Furthermore, displaying all that the child is not allowed to play merely insights frustration, as opposed to many other internet mechanisms by which a parent can block an app, a website, or a game that is inappropriate- after which it no longer shows up.  Furthermore, many of the games in the user generated content are age appropriate for younger kids and are the more popular games.  So the curated option includes removing the ability for a child to play games which are both popular and age appropriate (ie islands).  

At the same time, Roblox does nothing to monitor inappropriate games with xenophobic or sexual themes and deprives the parent of the ability to block these games from a child.  The entire parental safety mechanism is wholly inadequate.  Every other type of platform allows for customization of age rated games, customization of chat mechanisms and the ability of the parent to help their child play safely.  This includes the internet itself where websites can be blocked or allowed.  Lastly, the ability to monitor roblox chats only, along with inability to monitor in-game chats without the parent watching live, the entire time, is a serious failure of the platform.  

This system sets parents up for failure and promotes frustration and resentment with the children.  Roblox claims to be concerned about the safety and well-being of their players.  Yet they take no responsibility for monitoring user generated content, provide no realistic mechanism which allows a parent to work with the child to determine what is appropriate (which varies greatly even between ages 9 and 12) and places all responsibility of reporting inappropriate content or behavior on the users.  Which, for the record, they do little or nothing about.  

I have personally reported games which I have witnessed sexual content and the encouragement of inappropriate and sexual behavior.  I have provided screenshots as proof. I have received nothing more than a canned response saying I should enable “curated content” only and refusing to address the inability to chat once this is implemented.  I have reported games which promote violence in conjunction with xenophobic themes.  I provided screenshots in support thereof.  Again, I received a canned response about parental controls.  Never mind the fact that child can create a new account with nothing more than a name and a birthdate - which does nothing to block content aside from a few ### in chats.  

At what point does Roblox take any responsibility for their content and/or lack of useful safety settings which would at least allow a parent to have reasonable controls over what their child can play and do on the platform. 

If a Roblox is going to market to kids from 6 years of age (see their toys) to young adults, there needs to be more than the current useless, black and white, all or nothing parental controls.  The technology exists.  They simply refuse to implement it and/or make it available.  I can only assume their “concern for the children”propaganda is nothing more than a public affairs CYA as they hoist all of the responsibility of monitoring behavior and content of their platform onto their young players. Which maybe, just maybe would fly if they ever actually did anything about it.  But their statements re their concern are disingenuous at best given the lack of response when said reports are actually made.  

This is not unreasonable and this is not the ranting of a parent who doesn’t want to monitor their child’s activity.  These are the words of a concerned parent watching a company market to millions of young children, who are desperate for socialization (especially during a pandemic) and making millions on them and their parents while depriving users and their parents of the most simplistic of tools needed to ensure the safety and well being of our kids.  

And on a final note- the recommendations by some that parents can just block the game as a whole, or just set the all or nothing restrictions and get over it is not a response or solution.  It’s ignoring the problem and passing the buck.",t5_2m7jy9,11,0.93

This raises all kinds of alarm bells in my mind with other children globally who may be in a similar position.

I would advise any parent in this situation to 1) check if your little ones have played this and if so maybe check any new friend adds.

i joined this community to post this so I am sorry if its against any community standards I'm not here to scaremonger parents or badmouth the platform or even the developers of this game but it caused me a great concern
